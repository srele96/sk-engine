i may have gone too far because I originally wanted to do opengl, so I might go back to doing opengl and vulkan... now I understand the core that buffers bound are used to render and current draw call adds to the framebuffer what's currently in buffer then computed by GPU, ill continue working through that idea, give me a conceptual idea of how the mesh data is stored, give me a c++ class for a mesh of how it would store the data, give me a sample where u pretend model's data is loaded and I have to render it, I actually consider writing a render that loads  data that I render in blender, because its annoying to write vertices by myself in the program hrd coded fuck
ChatGPT

Your interest in OpenGL and Vulkan for graphics programming is a great direction, especially if you're considering working with models created in tools like Blender. Let's break this down into two parts: first, the conceptual idea of how mesh data is stored and structured, and second, a simple C++ class representing a mesh.
Conceptual Idea of Mesh Data Storage

In graphics programming, a mesh typically consists of several components:

    Vertices: The fundamental points in 3D space that make up the mesh. Each vertex can have multiple attributes such as position, normal, texture coordinates, and color.

    Indices: Many meshes use indexed drawing. Indices are integer values that refer to vertices in the vertex array, allowing you to reuse vertices to form multiple polygons (typically triangles).

    Normals: Vectors used for lighting calculations, which are perpendicular to the surface of the mesh.

    Texture Coordinates (UVs): Coordinates that map textures to the mesh.

    Buffers: In OpenGL, data like vertices, indices, normals, and UVs are often stored in buffer objects (VBOs, EBOs) for efficient rendering by the GPU.

Example C++ Mesh Class

Here’s a simple representation of a mesh class in C++:

cpp

#include <vector>
#include <glad/glad.h> // For OpenGL functions

struct Vertex {
    glm::vec3 position;
    glm::vec3 normal;
    glm::vec2 texCoords;
};

class Mesh {
public:
    Mesh(const std::vector<Vertex>& vertices, const std::vector<GLuint>& indices) {
        this->vertices = vertices;
        this->indices = indices;
        setupMesh();
    }

    void Draw() {
        glBindVertexArray(VAO);
        glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, indices.size(), GL_UNSIGNED_INT, 0);
        glBindVertexArray(0);
    }

private:
    std::vector<Vertex> vertices;
    std::vector<GLuint> indices;
    GLuint VAO, VBO, EBO;

    void setupMesh() {
        glGenVertexArrays(1, &VAO);
        glGenBuffers(1, &VBO);
        glGenBuffers(1, &EBO);

        glBindVertexArray(VAO);

        glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, VBO);
        glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vertices.size() * sizeof(Vertex), &vertices[0], GL_STATIC_DRAW);

        glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, EBO);
        glBufferData(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, indices.size() * sizeof(GLuint), &indices[0], GL_STATIC_DRAW);

        // Set vertex attribute pointers
        // Position attribute
        glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, sizeof(Vertex), (void*)0);
        glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);
        // Normal attribute
        glVertexAttribPointer(1, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, sizeof(Vertex), (void*)offsetof(Vertex, normal));
        glEnableVertexAttribArray(1);
        // Texture attribute
        glVertexAttribPointer(2, 2, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, sizeof(Vertex), (void*)offsetof(Vertex, texCoords));
        glEnableVertexAttribArray(2);

        glBindVertexArray(0);
    }
};

Sample Usage

cpp

// Pretend we loaded this data from a model
std::vector<Vertex> vertices = {...};
std::vector<GLuint> indices = {...};

Mesh myMesh(vertices, indices);

// In your render loop
myMesh.Draw();

Loading Models from Blender

For loading models created in Blender or other 3D modeling software, you typically use a model loading library like Assimp (Open Asset Import Library). This library can import various 3D model formats and translate them into a data structure that your program can understand and render.
Notes

    OpenGL Initialization: Ensure that you have initialized OpenGL and created a context before using these OpenGL calls.
    GLM Library: This example uses the GLM library for math operations, which is a common practice in OpenGL programming.
    Error Handling: In a real application, you should include error handling, especially when working with file I/O and GPU resources.
    Extensions: For more advanced features, you might also need to work with OpenGL extensions.

This setup gives you a foundational structure for rendering 3D models in OpenGL. The actual implementation can get more complex, especially when dealing with textures, lighting, and more advanced graphics techniques.
User
why in opengl do we bind vertex and element buffer object both at same time? i thought only one of the two can be bound at a time
ChatGPT

In OpenGL, when dealing with vertex data and element (index) data, both a Vertex Buffer Object (VBO) and an Element Buffer Object (EBO) are often used in tandem, but they serve different purposes and are bound to different targets. Here's why they are both bound at the same time:
Vertex Buffer Object (VBO)

    Purpose: Stores vertex data like positions, normals, texture coordinates, etc.
    Binding Target: Bound to GL_ARRAY_BUFFER.
    Functionality: VBOs are used to upload vertex data to the GPU and to specify how that data is organized.

Element Buffer Object (EBO) or Index Buffer Object (IBO)

    Purpose: Stores indices that define how vertices are connected to form primitives (like triangles).
    Binding Target: Bound to GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER.
    Functionality: EBOs tell OpenGL which vertices to use and in what order without duplicating vertex data.

Why Bind Both?

    Different Buffer Types: Since VBOs and EBOs are bound to different targets (GL_ARRAY_BUFFER and GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, respectively), they do not conflict with each other. You can bind both simultaneously because they serve different roles in the rendering process.
    Efficiency: Using an EBO allows you to reuse vertices. For example, when drawing a square (two triangles), you can define just four vertices and use six indices to form the triangles, rather than defining six separate vertices.
    OpenGL State Machine: In OpenGL, when you bind a buffer, you're telling OpenGL which buffer to use for the upcoming operations. When you bind a VBO and then an EBO, you're setting up the state for a drawing operation where the vertex data comes from the VBO and the indexing comes from the EBO.
    VertexArrayObject (VAO): When you use a VAO (which is common and recommended), binding a VBO and an EBO while a VAO is bound essentially links these buffers to the VAO. This allows you to store the entire configuration of vertex and index buffers in a single VAO, which can be re-bound with a single call in your rendering loop.

Example Sequence

Here's a simplified sequence to illustrate the process:

    Bind VAO: glBindVertexArray(vao);
    Bind VBO and Set Vertex Attributes:
        glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo);
        glVertexAttribPointer(...);
        glEnableVertexAttribArray(...);
    Bind EBO: glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, ebo);
    Draw Call: Use glDrawElements(...) to draw using the indices in the EBO.

This setup allows you to efficiently and clearly define how your vertex and index data should be used in rendering operations. It's a fundamental part of using modern OpenGL effectively.
User
why does opengl need vertex attrib pointer, what is it used for, what does it represent? for what can I use it?
ChatGPT

The glVertexAttribPointer function in OpenGL is crucial for specifying how vertex data is organized and how it should be interpreted by the graphics pipeline. Here’s a breakdown of its purpose and usage:
What It Is Used For

    Specifying Vertex Attribute Format: It tells OpenGL how to interpret the vertex data stored in a Vertex Buffer Object (VBO). For instance, it can specify how to read positions, colors, normals, texture coordinates, etc., from the VBO.

    Associating Vertex Attributes with Shader Variables: It links vertex data to vertex shader attributes. When you define attributes in your vertex shader (like vec3 position;), glVertexAttribPointer tells OpenGL how to feed the vertex data into these attributes.

What It Represents

    Attribute Index: This is the location of the vertex attribute in the vertex shader. It corresponds to the layout location you specify in the shader (e.g., layout(location = 0) in vec3 position;).
    Size: Number of components per vertex attribute (e.g., 2 for texture coordinates, 3 for position vertices, etc.).
    Type: Data type of each component (e.g., GL_FLOAT, GL_INT).
    Normalized: Whether fixed-point data values should be normalized or converted directly.
    Stride: Byte offset between consecutive vertex attributes. This can be 0 if attributes are tightly packed.
    Pointer/Offset: Specifies an offset of the first component of the first attribute in the buffer.

Usage Examples

    Position Attribute: If you have an array of 3D vertices, you use glVertexAttribPointer to tell OpenGL that each vertex attribute consists of three floats (representing the x, y, and z coordinates).

    cpp

glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 3 * sizeof(float), (void*)0);
glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);

Combined Data (e.g., Position and Color): If your VBO contains an array where each vertex consists of position followed by color, the stride parameter tells OpenGL the total size of a vertex, and the pointer parameter specifies the start of each attribute.

cpp

    // Position attribute
    glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 6 * sizeof(float), (void*)0);
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);
    // Color attribute
    glVertexAttribPointer(1, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 6 * sizeof(float), (void*)(3 * sizeof(float)));
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(1);

Why It's Important

    Flexibility: Allows you to structure your vertex data in various ways to suit your application's needs.
    Efficiency: Enables efficient batch processing of vertex data by the GPU.
    Shader Communication: Provides a direct link between your vertex data and the vertex shader, enabling complex rendering techniques and shaders.

In summary, glVertexAttribPointer is a key function in OpenGL for managing vertex data. It offers the flexibility to define how this data is organized and how it should be interpreted by the graphics pipeline, which is fundamental for rendering in OpenGL.
User
do i have to bind  all 3? vao vbo and ebo?
ChatGPT

In OpenGL, the process of binding the Vertex Array Object (VAO), Vertex Buffer Object (VBO), and Element Buffer Object (EBO) is a crucial step for setting up and executing rendering operations. Here's a brief explanation of the role of each and whether they all need to be bound:
VAO (Vertex Array Object)

    Role: Acts as a container for the state associated with the definitions of vertex data (like vertex attribute pointers).
    Binding Requirement: You need to bind the VAO once to tell OpenGL you're going to define or use the vertex data state it contains.

VBO (Vertex Buffer Object)

    Role: Stores the actual vertex data, like positions, normals, texture coordinates, etc.
    Binding Requirement: You bind the VBO before specifying vertex attribute pointers with glVertexAttribPointer. This associates the VBO with the currently bound VAO.

EBO (Element Buffer Object) or IBO (Index Buffer Object)

    Role: Stores indices used for indexed drawing, allowing reuse of vertices.
    Binding Requirement: If you are using indexed drawing, you bind the EBO while the VAO is bound. This associates the EBO with the currently bound VAO.

Binding Process

    Bind VAO: Bind the VAO to let OpenGL know you're setting up or using the vertex attribute configuration stored in it.

    cpp

glBindVertexArray(vao);

Bind VBO: Bind the VBO to load vertex data into it and then to specify vertex attribute pointers.

cpp

glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo);
glVertexAttribPointer(...);
glEnableVertexAttribArray(...);

Bind EBO: If using indexed drawing, bind the EBO while the VAO is still bound.

cpp

glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, ebo);

Unbind VAO (Optional): Once you've set up the vertex attribute pointers, you can unbind the VAO to prevent accidental modifications to it. The VBO and EBO are still indirectly bound via the VAO.

cpp

    glBindVertexArray(0);

At Rendering Time

When it's time to render:

    Bind VAO: Simply bind the VAO. It retains all the vertex attribute settings and the associated VBO and EBO.

    cpp

glBindVertexArray(vao);

Draw Call: Perform your draw call (glDrawArrays for non-indexed or glDrawElements for indexed drawing).

Unbind VAO: Optionally unbind the VAO after drawing to prevent unintended state changes.

cpp

    glBindVertexArray(0);

Summary

    You need to bind the VAO and VBO to set up your vertex attribute pointers.
    If using indexed drawing, you also need to bind the EBO, but this is done while the VAO is bound.
    At render time, only the VAO needs to be bound, as it keeps track of the VBO and EBO associated with it.

User
to which of the 3 buffers does vertex attrib pointer refer to? vao, vbo or ebo?
ChatGPT

The glVertexAttribPointer function is used to specify the format and location of vertex data within a Vertex Buffer Object (VBO), not a Vertex Array Object (VAO) or an Element Buffer Object (EBO). Here's how this works in the context of these three types of buffers:

    Vertex Buffer Object (VBO):
        The VBO is where your actual vertex data (like positions, normals, texture coordinates) is stored.
        When you call glVertexAttribPointer, you are telling OpenGL how to interpret the vertex data contained in the currently bound VBO.
        Example: If your VBO contains positions and colors for each vertex, glVertexAttribPointer helps you tell OpenGL how to read these positions and colors from the VBO.

    Vertex Array Object (VAO):
        The VAO is like a template that stores the vertex attribute configurations.
        When you bind a VAO and then set vertex attribute pointers (with glVertexAttribPointer), these configurations are stored in the VAO.
        The VAO does not directly hold vertex data. Instead, it remembers which VBOs to use and how to interpret the data in these VBOs.

    Element Buffer Object (EBO):
        The EBO (or IBO, Index Buffer Object) holds indices used for indexed drawing.
        It is not directly related to vertex attribute pointers. Its purpose is to tell OpenGL which vertices to use and in what order from the VBO.

Usage Summary

    Bind a VAO (to store vertex attribute configurations).
    Bind a VBO (where the vertex data is).
    Use glVertexAttribPointer to specify how to interpret the vertex data in the VBO. These settings are saved in the currently bound VAO.
    If using indexed drawing, bind an EBO (which is also remembered by the bound VAO).

By doing this, you're effectively creating a setup where the VAO knows which VBO to use and how to interpret its data, and if you're using indexed drawing, which EBO to use. When it comes time to draw, you just need to bind the appropriate VAO, and all of these settings will be used automatically.
User
when i bind vao, vbo, ebo, all 3 at the same time, which ones are available to GPU and which data out of 3 is going to be drawn?

also

vao + ebo

or

vbo + vertex attrib pointer

these are valid combinations if I get it right?
ChatGPT

When you bind a VAO (Vertex Array Object), a VBO (Vertex Buffer Object), and an EBO (Element Buffer Object) in OpenGL, it's important to understand how these objects interact with each other and what data is available to the GPU for rendering.
Binding VAO, VBO, and EBO Together

    Which Data is Available to the GPU:
        When a VAO is bound, it stores the format of the vertex data (as specified by glVertexAttribPointer) and references to any VBOs and EBOs bound while it is active.
        The VBO contains the actual vertex data (like positions, normals, texture coordinates).
        The EBO contains index data that tells OpenGL which vertices to draw and in what order.

    What Gets Drawn:
        During a draw call (like glDrawElements), OpenGL uses the vertex data from the VBO(s) referenced by the currently bound VAO and the index data from the EBO to render the geometry.
        If glDrawArrays is used instead of glDrawElements, OpenGL renders vertices in the order they appear in the VBO without using the EBO.

Valid Combinations

    VAO + EBO:
        This combination is valid and common when using indexed drawing.
        The VAO holds the state of vertex attribute configurations, and the EBO contains the indices for drawing.
        However, remember that the VAO also needs to have VBO(s) associated with it (this association happens when you bind a VBO and then call glVertexAttribPointer while a VAO is bound).

    VBO + Vertex Attrib Pointer:
        This combination is used to specify how to interpret the vertex data in the VBO.
        It's essential to have a VAO bound when calling glVertexAttribPointer so that these configurations are stored in the VAO.
        Simply having a VBO and using glVertexAttribPointer without a VAO does not create a valid state for drawing in modern OpenGL (version 3.0 and above), as the VAO is necessary to store the vertex attribute configurations.

Summary

    For rendering, the GPU uses both the vertex data from the VBOs and the index data from the EBO, as referenced by the currently bound VAO.
    The combination of a VAO and an EBO is used for indexed drawing. The VAO must also have associated VBO(s) for this to be a complete and valid setup.
    A VBO and glVertexAttribPointer calls are part of the process to define vertex data layout, but they need to be associated with a VAO to create a valid rendering setup in modern OpenGL.

User
so all 3 should be bound and used with attrib pointer

vao - how the data is stored
vbo - data that's stored
ebo - indices to connect to meaningful shapes

vertex attrib pointer - is this one playing together only with vao? how? give example
ChatGPT

Exactly, your understanding is correct. Let me clarify the role of glVertexAttribPointer and how it interacts with the VAO and VBO.
How glVertexAttribPointer Works with VAO and VBO

glVertexAttribPointer is used to specify how vertex attribute data is laid out in the currently bound VBO. This information is then stored in the currently bound VAO. Here’s the process:

    Bind VAO: When you bind a VAO, OpenGL keeps track of vertex attribute configurations that are set after this point.
    Bind VBO: Binding a VBO makes it the current buffer for vertex data operations.
    Specify Vertex Attribute Format with glVertexAttribPointer: Calls to glVertexAttribPointer define the layout of the vertex data in the bound VBO. These settings are associated with the bound VAO. It tells OpenGL things like:
        How many components each attribute has (e.g., 3 for a position vector).
        The data type of each component (e.g., GL_FLOAT).
        Whether data should be normalized.
        The stride (space between consecutive vertex attributes).
        Offsets (where each attribute starts in the buffer).

Example

Consider a simple example where each vertex in the VBO contains a position (3 floats) and a color (3 floats):

cpp

// Bind the VAO
glBindVertexArray(vao);

// Bind the VBO
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo);

// Vertex positions
glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 6 * sizeof(float), (void*)0);
glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);

// Vertex colors
glVertexAttribPointer(1, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 6 * sizeof(float), (void*)(3 * sizeof(float)));
glEnableVertexAttribArray(1);

// Unbind the VAO to prevent further modification
glBindVertexArray(0);

In this example:

    Each vertex has 6 floats: 3 for the position and 3 for the color.
    The first call to glVertexAttribPointer specifies how to interpret the first 3 floats (position), and the second call specifies the next 3 floats (color).
    These settings are saved in the vao. When you later bind this VAO and issue a draw call, OpenGL uses these settings to correctly interpret the vertex data.

Interaction with EBO

If you're using an EBO for indexed drawing, you would also bind the EBO after binding the VAO (and before unbinding the VAO). This associates the EBO with the VAO as well. During a draw call, OpenGL uses the indices in the EBO to fetch vertex data from the VBO according to the layout specified by glVertexAttribPointer.
Summary

    glVertexAttribPointer works in conjunction with both VAO and VBO.
    It specifies the layout of the vertex data in the VBO and saves this configuration in the VAO.
    This setup allows OpenGL to correctly process vertex data during rendering.

User
and how would we specify that each vertex has 9 floats or 12 floats where each 3 float represent something else? what are valid usages?
ChatGPT

To specify that each vertex in your Vertex Buffer Object (VBO) consists of more complex data, like 9 or 12 floats where each set of 3 floats represents a different attribute (such as position, color, normal, etc.), you use multiple calls to glVertexAttribPointer. Each call will define a specific attribute of the vertex and how to interpret the data for that attribute.

Let's break down two scenarios: one where each vertex consists of 9 floats, and another with 12 floats.
Scenario 1: Vertex with 9 Floats

Suppose each vertex has 9 floats arranged as follows:

    3 floats for position (x, y, z)
    3 floats for color (r, g, b)
    3 floats for texture coordinates (u, v, w)

Here's how you set this up:

cpp

glBindVertexArray(vao);
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo);

// Position attribute
glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 9 * sizeof(float), (void*)0);
glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);

// Color attribute
glVertexAttribPointer(1, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 9 * sizeof(float), (void*)(3 * sizeof(float)));
glEnableVertexAttribArray(1);

// Texture coordinates attribute
glVertexAttribPointer(2, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 9 * sizeof(float), (void*)(6 * sizeof(float)));
glEnableVertexAttribArray(2);

glBindVertexArray(0);

Scenario 2: Vertex with 12 Floats

Now, let's assume each vertex has 12 floats arranged like this:

    3 floats for position (x, y, z)
    3 floats for color (r, g, b)
    3 floats for normal (nx, ny, nz)
    3 floats for texture coordinates (u, v, w)

The setup would be:

cpp

glBindVertexArray(vao);
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo);

// Position attribute
glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 12 * sizeof(float), (void*)0);
glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);

// Color attribute
glVertexAttribPointer(1, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 12 * sizeof(float), (void*)(3 * sizeof(float)));
glEnableVertexAttribArray(1);

// Normal attribute
glVertexAttribPointer(2, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 12 * sizeof(float), (void*)(6 * sizeof(float)));
glEnableVertexAttribArray(2);

// Texture coordinates attribute
glVertexAttribPointer(3, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 12 * sizeof(float), (void*)(9 * sizeof(float)));
glEnableVertexAttribArray(3);

glBindVertexArray(0);

Key Points

    Stride: The stride parameter in glVertexAttribPointer is the total size of a vertex. In the first scenario, it's 9 * sizeof(float), and in the second, it's 12 * sizeof(float).

    Offset: The offset parameter (the last argument in glVertexAttribPointer) is the byte offset of the attribute in the vertex. For example, in the second scenario, the normal attribute starts after the first 6 floats (position and color), so its offset is 6 * sizeof(float).

    Attribute Index: This corresponds to the layout location in your vertex shader. Ensure your vertex shader has matching layout locations.

Valid Usages

    Positions, Colors, Normals, Texture Coordinates: These are the most common attributes. However, you can define other attributes like tangents, bitangents, or custom data as needed for your shaders.
    Mixing Data Types: While floats are common, you can use other data types. Ensure the data type in glVertexAttribPointer matches your actual data.

This flexibility allows OpenGL to handle a wide variety of vertex formats, making it suitable for different rendering techniques and shader configurations.
User
does binding ebo disrupt the vao that's currently bound?
ChatGPT

Binding an Element Buffer Object (EBO) while a Vertex Array Object (VAO) is bound does not disrupt the VAO. In fact, it does the opposite: it associates the EBO with the currently bound VAO. This is a key aspect of how VAOs work in OpenGL.
How EBO and VAO Interact

    VAO State: When you bind a VAO, it starts recording any vertex attribute configuration (done via calls like glVertexAttribPointer) and the EBO binding.
    Binding EBO: Binding an EBO while a VAO is bound actually ties the EBO to that VAO. This means the VAO "remembers" which EBO is associated with it.
    Draw Calls: Later, when you bind the VAO and issue a draw call (like glDrawElements), OpenGL uses the EBO that was bound to that VAO for indexed drawing. You don't need to bind the EBO again as long as you're using the same VAO.

Example Sequence

Here's a typical sequence demonstrating this:

    Bind VAO:

    cpp

glBindVertexArray(vao);

Set Up Vertex Attributes (with VBO bound):

cpp

glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo);
glVertexAttribPointer(...);
glEnableVertexAttribArray(...);

Bind EBO:

cpp

glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, ebo);

Unbind VAO:

cpp

    glBindVertexArray(0);

In this sequence, the EBO (ebo) is bound while the VAO (vao) is active, so the EBO is now associated with that VAO.
Subsequent Use

    When you want to render using this VAO, you only need to bind the VAO again:

    cpp

    glBindVertexArray(vao);
    glDrawElements(...); // Uses the EBO associated with the VAO
    glBindVertexArray(0);

    There's no need to bind the EBO again for drawing, as long as you're using the same VAO.

Important Note

    Once an EBO is associated with a VAO, it should not be unbound while the VAO is still bound. Unbinding the EBO while the VAO is bound can lead to the VAO losing its association with the EBO. If you need to unbind the EBO, do it after unbinding the VAO.

In conclusion, binding an EBO does not disrupt the currently bound VAO. Rather, it is a crucial step in establishing the relationship between the VAO and the EBO for indexed drawing in OpenGL.
User
give example for 

VAO State: When you bind a VAO, it starts recording any vertex attribute configuration (done via calls like glVertexAttribPointer) and the EBO binding.
ChatGPT

Certainly! Let's go through an example where we create a Vertex Array Object (VAO), a Vertex Buffer Object (VBO), and an Element Buffer Object (EBO), and then set up vertex attribute configurations. This example will demonstrate how the VAO records the state of vertex attributes and the binding of the EBO.
Example: Setting up VAO, VBO, and EBO

Suppose we have a simple structure where each vertex consists of a 3D position and a color. Here's how we would set up the VAO, VBO, and EBO:
Step 1: Define Vertex Data and Indices

cpp

struct Vertex {
    glm::vec3 position; // 3D position
    glm::vec3 color;    // RGB color
};

std::vector<Vertex> vertices = {
    // Vertex data (position, color)
    {{1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f}, {1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f}},  // Vertex 1
    {{0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f}, {0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f}},  // Vertex 2
    {{0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f}, {0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f}},  // Vertex 3
};

std::vector<GLuint> indices = {
    0, 1, 2 // Indices for drawing a triangle
};

Step 2: Generate and Bind VAO

cpp

GLuint vao;
glGenVertexArrays(1, &vao);
glBindVertexArray(vao);

Step 3: Generate, Bind, and Fill VBO

cpp

GLuint vbo;
glGenBuffers(1, &vbo);
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo);
glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vertices.size() * sizeof(Vertex), vertices.data(), GL_STATIC_DRAW);

Step 4: Set Vertex Attribute Pointers

cpp

// Position attribute
glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, sizeof(Vertex), (void*)offsetof(Vertex, position));
glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);

// Color attribute
glVertexAttribPointer(1, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, sizeof(Vertex), (void*)offsetof(Vertex, color));
glEnableVertexAttribArray(1);

Step 5: Generate, Bind, and Fill EBO

cpp

GLuint ebo;
glGenBuffers(1, &ebo);
glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, ebo);
glBufferData(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, indices.size() * sizeof(GLuint), indices.data(), GL_STATIC_DRAW);

Step 6: Unbind VAO

cpp

glBindVertexArray(0);

How the VAO Records the State

    When we bind the VAO and then perform operations like binding the VBO, setting vertex attribute pointers, and binding the EBO, the VAO "records" this setup.
    The glVertexAttribPointer calls define how OpenGL should interpret the vertex data in the VBO. These configurations are associated with the currently bound VAO (vao).
    Binding the EBO while the VAO is bound associates the EBO with the VAO.

Rendering with the VAO

To render this setup, you'd later do:

cpp

glBindVertexArray(vao);
glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, indices.size(), GL_UNSIGNED_INT, 0);
glBindVertexArray(0);

    The glDrawElements call uses the vertex attribute configurations and the EBO associated with the bound VAO to render the geometry.

Conclusion

In this example, the VAO (vao) records:

    The vertex attribute configurations set by glVertexAttribPointer.
    The association with the VBO (vbo) and EBO (ebo).

This makes it easy to use the entire setup for rendering with just a few calls, as the VAO stores all the necessary state information.

does it mean that VAO is simply a storage mechanism for vbo, ebo, and vertex attrib pointer calls in this case ? all that setup is st ored for currently bound vao, which means that I can store N vaos, and later when I want to render that in one render call, I can do

for each vao
  bind vao
  draw

did I get it right?

Yes, you've got it exactly right! The Vertex Array Object (VAO) in OpenGL acts as a container that stores all the state related to the definitions of vertex attributes and the associations with Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs) and Element Buffer Objects (EBOs). This setup makes it much more efficient and organized to manage multiple sets of vertex data and attributes.
VAO as a Storage Mechanism

    When you bind a VAO and then perform operations like setting vertex attribute pointers (glVertexAttribPointer) and binding VBOs/EBOs, the VAO stores this configuration.
    The VAO keeps track of:
        Which VBOs are being used and how vertex data in these VBOs should be interpreted (as specified by glVertexAttribPointer).
        The EBO (if used) associated with it for indexed drawing.

Using Multiple VAOs

    You can create multiple VAOs for different sets of vertex data and configurations. Each VAO represents a different "object" or "part" of your scene with its own vertex attributes and element indices.
    When rendering, you can switch between these VAOs to render different objects.

Example: Rendering with Multiple VAOs

cpp

std::vector<GLuint> vaos(N); // Assuming N VAOs
// ... setup each VAO with specific VBO, EBO, and vertex attribute configurations ...

for (GLuint vao : vaos) {
    glBindVertexArray(vao);
    glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, /* number of indices */, GL_UNSIGNED_INT, 0);
    // Or glDrawArrays, depending on your setup
}

In this example, each vao in vaos represents a different configuration of vertex data and attributes. By binding each vao and calling glDrawElements or glDrawArrays, you render the respective geometry associated with each vao.
Benefits of This Approach

    Organized and Efficient: This method is more organized and can be more efficient, especially in complex scenes where you have multiple objects, each with different vertex formats and data.
    State Management: It simplifies OpenGL state management since you don't need to repeatedly set up vertex attribute pointers and bind VBOs/EBOs for each draw call. Instead, you just bind the appropriate VAO.
    Flexibility: It allows for greater flexibility in rendering different types of objects. Each VAO can represent a different mesh or part of a mesh with its own unique attributes.

In summary, your understanding is correct. VAOs are essentially a way to save and restore sets of configurations for rendering, and you can efficiently manage and render multiple objects by switching between different VAOs.

but if i render immediately, can i skip using vaos? does it mean vbo ebo and vertex attrib pointer don't get saved anywhere?

Yes, you can technically render in OpenGL without explicitly using Vertex Array Objects (VAOs), especially in legacy OpenGL (prior to version 3.0). However, the way this works and its implications depend on the version of OpenGL you're using.
Legacy OpenGL (Before 3.0)

In older versions of OpenGL (pre-3.0, often referred to as "fixed-function pipeline" OpenGL), you can render directly using Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs) and client-side state without needing a VAO:

    Bind VBO and set up vertex attribute pointers:

    cpp

glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo);
glVertexPointer(...); // and similar functions for color, texture coordinates, etc.
glEnableClientState(GL_VERTEX_ARRAY); // and similar for other attributes

Bind EBO (if using indexed drawing):

cpp

glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, ebo);

Render:

cpp

    glDrawElements(...); // or glDrawArrays(...)

In this older approach, the vertex attribute configurations are part of the client-side state and not encapsulated in a VAO.
Modern OpenGL (3.0 and Above)

With the introduction of OpenGL 3.0 and the Core Profile, VAOs became a required part of the rendering pipeline:

    Core Profile Requirement: In the Core Profile of OpenGL 3.0 and later, you must use a VAO to render. If you try to render without a VAO bound, OpenGL will not draw anything, and you may get an error.
    Immediate Mode: The immediate mode (glBegin/glEnd) and fixed-function pipeline were deprecated and then removed in later versions, pushing towards the use of VAOs and VBOs.

What Happens If You Don't Use VAOs in Modern OpenGL?

    Compatibility Profile: Some implementations may allow rendering without VAOs if you use the Compatibility Profile, but this is not guaranteed to work across all platforms and drivers.
    State Not Saved: If you skip using VAOs in contexts where it's allowed, the vertex attribute configurations (set by glVertexAttribPointer) and the bindings of VBOs and EBOs are not saved. This means you would have to set up these configurations every time you render, which is less efficient and goes against the modern OpenGL design philosophy.

Best Practice

    Always Use VAOs in Modern OpenGL: It is a best practice to always use VAOs in modern OpenGL. They encapsulate the vertex attribute state and make your code cleaner, more efficient, and more compatible with the core functionality of modern OpenGL.

In summary, while you can skip using VAOs in legacy OpenGL or under certain compatibility modes, it's generally not advisable in modern OpenGL. Using VAOs is the standard approach and ensures compatibility with the core specifications of OpenGL 3.0 and later.
