vcpkg build assimp with custom cmake flags
ChatGPT

To build the assimp library using vcpkg with custom CMake flags, you need to follow a few steps. vcpkg is a C++ library manager that simplifies the process of managing C++ libraries in your projects. Here's a general guide:

    Install vcpkg (if not already installed):
    You need to have vcpkg installed on your system. You can clone it from its GitHub repository and then bootstrap it. Here's a quick guide:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh  # On Linux or MacOS
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat  # On Windows

Integrate vcpkg with your build (optional but recommended):
This step allows you to use vcpkg seamlessly with your CMake projects.

bash

./vcpkg integrate install

Customize the Portfile or Use an Overlay Port:
vcpkg uses port files to manage the build process. To customize CMake flags, you have two options:

    Modify the Portfile: Locate the assimp port file in the ports directory of your vcpkg installation and modify the CMake arguments. This method is not recommended as it can be overwritten by updates.

    Create an Overlay Port: This is a more robust method. Create a new directory outside your vcpkg directory, and inside it, create a folder named assimp. Copy the portfile.cmake from the vcpkg/ports/assimp directory to your new assimp directory and modify it there.

    In your custom portfile.cmake, you can alter the vcpkg_configure_cmake call to include your custom flags:

    cmake

    vcpkg_configure_cmake(
        SOURCE_PATH ${SOURCE_PATH}
        PREFER_NINJA
        OPTIONS
            -DYOUR_CUSTOM_FLAG=VALUE
            # Add additional flags here
    )

Build the Library:
Now, use vcpkg to install assimp with your modifications. If you're using an overlay port, specify the path to your custom ports directory using the --overlay-ports flag:

bash

    ./vcpkg install assimp --overlay-ports=/path/to/custom/ports

    Using the Library in Your Project:
    In your CMake project, find and link against the assimp library as you would normally. Since vcpkg is integrated with your build environment, it should handle the paths automatically.

Remember to always back up your changes and be aware that updating vcpkg might overwrite any modifications you've made directly to the port files in the vcpkg directory. Using overlay ports is safer in this regard, as it keeps your customizations separate from the main vcpkg installation.

vcpkg doesnt use custom passed flags

CMake Warning:
  Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:

    ASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_EXPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT
    ASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_IMPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT
    ASSIMP_BUILD_GLTF_IMPORTER

how can I find out why?
ChatGPT

If the custom flags you've passed to vcpkg for building assimp are not being used, resulting in CMake warnings, there are several steps you can take to diagnose and resolve this issue:

    Check the CMakeLists.txt of Assimp:
        The flags you are passing must be recognized by the CMakeLists.txt file of the assimp library. Open this file and look for the variables you are trying to set (e.g., ASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_EXPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT). If these variables are not present or are named differently, the flags will not have any effect.
        Ensure that the version of assimp you are building supports these flags. Sometimes, flags or their behavior change between versions.

    Review the portfile.cmake:
        Ensure that your modifications to the portfile.cmake (or the overlay port you created) are correctly passing the variables to the CMake configuration step. The syntax should correctly add these variables as options in the vcpkg_configure_cmake call.

vcpkg overlay ports alternatives
ChatGPT

Using vcpkg overlay ports can be a powerful way to customize and manage dependencies in your projects. However, if you're looking for alternatives to this approach, there are a few options you might consider:

    Forking and Modifying the Main vcpkg Repository: Instead of using overlay ports, you can fork the main vcpkg repository and modify the ports directly. This approach allows you to maintain a custom version of vcpkg with your changes. The downside is that keeping up with upstream changes can be more challenging.

    Using Custom Registries: vcpkg supports custom registries, which allow you to maintain a separate repository of ports. This can be more manageable than overlay ports for large sets of custom packages or for sharing these packages across multiple projects.

    Patch Files: For minor changes, you might prefer to use patch files. You can apply patches to the source code of a library when it's being built by vcpkg. This is less intrusive than maintaining a whole separate port and can be easier to manage for small tweaks.

    Conan or CMake: Alternatives to vcpkg itself include package managers like Conan, which also supports C++ packages and has a different approach to managing dependencies. CMake, while not a package manager, can be used in conjunction with FetchContent or ExternalProject to directly integrate dependencies from source.

    Submodules or Subtrees in Git: If you're comfortable with Git, using submodules or subtrees to include dependencies directly in your project's repository can be a straightforward approach. This is more manual but gives you complete control over the version and modifications of your dependencies.

    Manually Managing Dependencies: In some cases, especially for smaller projects or projects with few dependencies, manually managing dependencies (downloading, building, and linking them yourself) is a viable approach.

Each of these alternatives comes with its own set of trade-offs in terms of ease of use, flexibility, and maintenance overhead. The best choice depends on the specific needs and constraints of your project.

im looking for a way to tell vcpkg to use these flags when building assimp library

-DASSIMP_BUILD_GLTF_IMPORTER=ON -DASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_IMPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT=OFF -DASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_EXPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT=OFF
ChatGPT

To configure vcpkg to use specific build flags when building the assimp library, you can create a custom port overlay. This allows you to modify how vcpkg builds a specific package. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

    Create a Custom Port Directory:
    First, create a directory that will hold your custom port configurations. This can be anywhere on your system. For example, you might create a directory named custom-ports in your home directory.

    Copy the Existing assimp Port Files:
    Inside your custom-ports directory, create a subdirectory for assimp. Then, copy the existing assimp port files from the vcpkg ports directory (vcpkg/ports/assimp) into your new custom-ports/assimp directory.

    Modify the Portfile:
    In your custom-ports/assimp directory, you will find a file named Portfile. Open this file in a text editor. Locate the part of the file where the build configurations are specified. You will need to modify the vcpkg_configure_cmake call to include your custom flags:

    cmake

vcpkg_configure_cmake(
    SOURCE_PATH ${SOURCE_PATH}
    PREFER_NINJA
    OPTIONS
        -DASSIMP_BUILD_GLTF_IMPORTER=ON
        -DASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_IMPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT=OFF
        -DASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_EXPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT=OFF
    # Add any other options you need here
)

Use the Custom Port with vcpkg:
When you run vcpkg to install assimp, use the --overlay-ports option to specify your custom ports directory. For example:

sh

    ./vcpkg install assimp --overlay-ports=/path/to/custom-ports

    Replace /path/to/custom-ports with the actual path to your custom ports directory.

    Install the Library:

User
are there alternatives to custom port overlay because it feels like too much work only to achieve such a thing, if there is no alternative approach with lesser effort ill do the custom port, I'm wondering if custom port makes sense?

ChatGPT

If you're looking for a simpler alternative to creating a custom port overlay in vcpkg for setting specific build flags, you can try the following approach. It's more direct and involves modifying the build process temporarily for your current project:

    Install the Library Normally:
    First, install the assimp library using vcpkg as you normally would. Don't worry about the specific build flags at this stage. This step is just to ensure you have all the necessary files and configurations in place.

    sh

./vcpkg install assimp

Modify the Build Configuration Manually:
After installing, go to the installed package directory in vcpkg. This is typically found in [vcpkg-root]/buildtrees/assimp. Here, you'll find the build configuration files and possibly a CMake cache file (CMakeCache.txt).

Edit the CMake Configuration:
Open the CMakeCache.txt file or other relevant configuration files in a text editor. Manually change the settings to reflect your desired build flags. For example, find and modify the lines:

ruby

ASSIMP_BUILD_GLTF_IMPORTER:BOOL=OFF
ASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_IMPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT:BOOL=ON
ASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_EXPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT:BOOL=ON

Change these to:

ruby

ASSIMP_BUILD_GLTF_IMPORTER:BOOL=ON
ASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_IMPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT:BOOL=OFF
ASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_EXPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT:BOOL=OFF

Rebuild the Library:
After making these changes, rebuild the assimp library. You can do this by navigating to the assimp build directory in the vcpkg tree and running the build command, typically using CMake and your build system (like Make or Ninja).

sh

    cmake --build . --config Release

    Use the Rebuilt Library in Your Project:
    The rebuilt version of assimp with your specified flags should now be used in your project.

This approach is a bit of a workaround and doesn't utilize vcpkg's features as intended. It's more of a quick-and-dirty method to modify build parameters without setting up a custom overlay port. It's important to note that this approach is more fragile: if you update or reinstall the library through vcpkg, your changes will be overwritten and you'll have to redo the manual steps.

Using a custom port overlay is the more robust and repeatable method, especially if you need to share your project setup with others or maintain it over a longer period. While it might seem like more work upfront, it can save time and hassle in the long run.

powershell 7 command to recursively copy

C:\src\vcpkg\ports\assimp to C:\Users\srecko\Documents\my_projects\container-sk-experiments\sk-engine\vcpkg
ChatGPT

To recursively copy the contents of the C:\src\vcpkg\ports\assimp directory to C:\Users\srecko\Documents\my_projects\container-sk-experiments\sk-engine\vcpkg using PowerShell 7, you can use the Copy-Item cmdlet with the -Recurse flag. This flag ensures that the command copies all subdirectories and files within them.

Here's the command you would use:

powershell

Copy-Item -Path "C:\src\vcpkg\ports\assimp\*" -Destination "C:\Users\srecko\Documents\my_projects\container-sk-experiments\sk-engine\vcpkg" -Recurse

A few points to note:

    Make sure the destination directory (C:\Users\srecko\Documents\my_projects\container-sk-experiments\sk-engine\vcpkg) exists before running the command. If it doesn't, you can create it using the New-Item cmdlet.
    The \* at the end of the source path ensures that all contents of the directory, but not the directory itself, are copied. If you want to include the assimp directory in the destination path, you should adjust the destination path accordingly.
    If you want the command to provide feedback as it copies files, you can add the -Verbose flag.

Remember, it's good practice to first run such commands with the -WhatIf flag to preview their actions without actually performing them. This can help you avoid unintentional file operations:

powershell

Copy-Item -Path "C:\src\vcpkg\ports\assimp\*" -Destination "C:\Users\srecko\Documents\my_projects\container-sk-experiments\sk-engine\vcpkg" -Recurse -WhatIf

This will show you what the command would do without actually copying any files.

we are currently overriding these flags because assimp is too large and build time is ~10 minutes or longer, the only way to provide custom build flags to assimp was copying vcpkg/ports/assimp and overwriting the provided flags

if build fails, save these flags, overwrite the port maintained here and add back the flags

# Assimp Customization Notice:

Due to the considerable size of the Assimp library and its extensive build time, often exceeding 10 minutes, we've implemented a targeted approach to mitigate this issue. Our strategy involves overriding specific build flags for Assimp to streamline its size and reduce build duration effectively.

The process we've adopted is as follows:

1. Initially, copy the `vcpkg/ports/assimp` directory. This serves as the foundation for our customizations.
2. Subsequently, modify the build flags within this copied directory. This step is crucial as it tailors the Assimp build process to our specific requirements, primarily focusing on reducing its footprint and build time.
3. In the event of a build failure, it's imperative to preserve these customized flags. After safeguarding them, proceed to overwrite the port located in our maintained directory.
4. Post overwrite, reintegrate the preserved flags back into the configuration. This ensures that our customizations persist, maintaining the efficiency gains we've achieved.

This methodology, while unconventional, is a testament to our commitment to optimizing our build process and maintaining efficiency in our workflow.

Regarding alternatives to Assimp for loading GLTF models, there are a few options you can consider:

    tinygltf: A header-only C++11 library for loading GLTF 2.0 files. It's lightweight and easy to integrate into projects.

    Microsoft's DirectX Tool Kit: Specifically for DirectX applications, this toolkit includes a model loader that supports GLTF.

    Google's Filament: While primarily a rendering engine, Filament comes with tools for GLTF 2.0 loading and is known for its high-quality rendering.

    CesiumJS: If you're working in a web context, CesiumJS can load GLTF models, though it's more than just a model loader and includes a full 3D geospatial platform.

    Three.js: Another web-based library that offers GLTF loading capabilities along with a comprehensive 3D graphics API.

Each of these alternatives has its strengths and might be more suitable than Assimp, depending on your specific requirements, especially if you are looking for something lighter or more specialized for GLTF models.

and inside ports I have assimp with copied content of the port
ChatGPT

Yes, your JSON configuration for vcpkg seems correct based on your description. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

    $schema: This line points to the JSON schema for vcpkg configurations. Including this helps with validation and autocompletion in supported JSON editors. It's a good practice to include this in your configuration file.

    overlay-ports: This line specifies a list of directories that vcpkg will use as overlay ports. In your case, you're pointing to ./vcpkg/ports. This means vcpkg will look in the ports directory within the vcpkg folder in your current working directory for any custom ports.
        If inside this ports directory you have an assimp folder with the copied content of the original vcpkg assimp port, vcpkg will use this custom version of the assimp port instead of the one in its main repository.

This setup is useful when you want to use a modified version of a library, like assimp in your case, without altering the main vcpkg repository. Just make sure that the structure of your custom assimp port matches that of the standard vcpkg ports, including the CONTROL or vcpkg.json file and the portfile.cmake file.
User
i dislike the idea to maintain the whole port just cus I wanna pass 3 build flags
ChatGPT

I understand your concern about maintaining a whole custom port in vcpkg just to change a few build flags. It can indeed feel like an overhead for a seemingly simple modification. Unfortunately, vcpkg doesn't currently provide a built-in, simpler method for overriding build options for individual libraries directly from the command line or via a simple configuration file.

However, here are a couple of alternative approaches that might be less cumbersome than maintaining a full custom port:

    Patch Files: Instead of copying the entire port, you could create a patch file that modifies the CMakeLists.txt or other relevant build files of the assimp library. You would then modify the portfile of assimp to apply this patch during the build process. This way, you're not duplicating the entire port, just adding a small modification. The downside is that you'll still need to monitor changes to the original port to ensure your patch remains applicable.

    Custom Build Script: If the modification is solely for your project's use, consider writing a custom script that builds assimp with your specific flags outside of vcpkg. You can then manually integrate the built library into your project. This method circumvents vcpkg, but it gives you full control over the build process.

    Feature Flags in vcpkg: Sometimes, vcpkg ports provide feature flags that can be used to customize the build. Check the CONTROL file or vcpkg.json of the assimp port to see if there are any feature flags that might turn off certain components or change the build configuration in a way that suits your needs.

    Contributing to vcpkg: If you believe your build configuration would be beneficial to others, consider contributing these changes back to the vcpkg repository. This way, the maintainers might integrate your changes, or provide an official feature flag for this kind of customization.

    Monitoring for vcpkg Updates: Keep an eye on updates to vcpkg. The tool is actively maintained, and newer versions might introduce features that simplify this process.

Each of these methods has its pros and cons, and the best choice depends on your specific requirements, the frequency of updates you expect, and how integral the assimp library is to your project.
User
how would the path file work?
ChatGPT

Creating a patch file to modify the build process of a library in vcpkg is a more streamlined approach than maintaining an entire custom port. Here's how you can create and use a patch file for the assimp library:
Step 1: Modify the Original Files

    Locate the Original Files: First, find the files in the assimp port that you need to modify. Typically, this would be the CMakeLists.txt file or similar configuration files within the assimp source.

    Make Your Changes: Edit these files to include your desired build flags. For example, you might add your flags (-DASSIMP_BUILD_GLTF_IMPORTER=ON, etc.) to the appropriate section in CMakeLists.txt.

Step 2: Create a Patch File

    Generate the Patch: After making the changes, create a patch file that contains the differences between the original and modified files. You can use a tool like diff on Unix-based systems or third-party tools on Windows. The command typically looks like:

    bash

    diff -u original_file.txt modified_file.txt > my_changes.patch

    Name and Place the Patch File: Name the patch file descriptively (e.g., assimp-custom-build-flags.patch) and place it in the port directory of assimp inside your vcpkg directory (typically vcpkg/ports/assimp/).

Step 3: Update the Portfile to Apply the Patch

    Edit the Portfile: Open the portfile.cmake file in the assimp port directory.

    Apply the Patch: Add a command in the portfile.cmake to apply the patch when vcpkg builds assimp. It usually looks something like this:

    cmake

    vcpkg_apply_patches(
        SOURCE_PATH ${SOURCE_PATH}
        PATCHES
            ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/assimp-custom-build-flags.patch
    )

Step 4: Install with Vcpkg

    Now, when you install assimp via vcpkg, it will apply your patch automatically and build assimp with your specified flags.

Considerations

    Maintainability: If assimp is updated and the sections you've patched change significantly, your patch might not apply cleanly and will need to be updated.
    Portability: This change is local to your vcpkg setup. If you need to replicate this setup elsewhere, you'll need to apply the same modifications.

This approach provides a middle ground between the full control of a custom port and the simplicity of using the standard vcpkg ports, making it a good option if your changes are relatively small and targeted.
User
yeah, nope, nope, nope, i think this is too much work to make something like this work, I will keep it in mind for later tho
ChatGPT

Absolutely, it's understandable. Working with patch files and customizing build processes can indeed be quite involved and may feel like overkill for just passing a few build flags. It's important to balance the effort against the benefits, especially for smaller or time-sensitive projects.

For now, if the current approach with vcpkg and the default assimp build configuration is manageable, sticking with it might be the best course of action. Sometimes, the simplest

CMake Warning:
  Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:

    ASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_EXPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT
    ASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_IMPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT
    ASSIMP_BUILD_GLTF_IMPORTER

why does it say that???? what is common way to do that?
ChatGPT

The warning you're seeing from CMake indicates that certain variables you've specified (in this case, ASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_EXPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT, ASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_IMPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT, and ASSIMP_BUILD_GLTF_IMPORTER) were not used in the configuration of the project you're trying to build. This usually happens for a few common reasons:

    Unused Variables: The variables you've set may not be relevant to the project or the specific build configuration you're using. It's possible that these variables are not referenced in the CMakeLists.txt file of the project.

    Typographical Errors: There might be typos in the variable names. Double-check the spelling and case sensitivity of the variable names against the documentation or the CMakeLists.txt file of the project.

    Incorrect Scope: The variables might be defined in a scope that is not accessible where they are needed. In CMake, variables can have different scopes (like directory, cache, etc.), and if they're not set in the correct scope, they won't be available where expected.

    Project Configuration: The project you're trying to configure may not support these options, or they might be obsolete. This can happen if the project's build system has changed but the documentation or your source of information has not been updated.

To resolve this issue:

    Check Documentation: Look at the project's documentation to ensure that these variables are valid and relevant for the version of the project you're working with.

    Review CMakeLists.txt: Check the CMakeLists.txt file(s) in the project to see if and how these variables are used. This can give you a clue about whether the variables are outdated, misspelled, or used under specific conditions only.

    Ensure Correct Usage: If these variables are part of a third-party library or module (like Assimp in your case), make sure you're including or linking this library correctly in your CMake configuration.

    Update Project or CMake: If you're using an older version of the project or CMake, consider updating them. Newer versions might have different variables or ways of handling configurations.

    Seek Help from Community: If you're still stuck, consider seeking help from the project's user community, such as forums, mailing lists, or issue trackers. Other users or the project maintainers can provide specific advice based on their experience.

In your specific case, since these variables are related to Assimp (a library to import and export various well-known 3D model formats), make sure you're using the correct version of Assimp and that your project's build system is set up to use these variables appropriately.
User
i was installing asimp using vcpkg and make and assimp is dependency, how can I let vcpkg know to use these when building assimp or assimp to pick them up?

basiicaly I want to use only some features of assimp
ChatGPT

When you're using vcpkg to manage dependencies like Assimp, and you want to customize the build process to include only certain features, you typically have two main approaches:

    Using Feature Packages in vcpkg: vcpkg often allows you to specify specific features of a library to install. These are usually termed as "feature packages". You can see if Assimp offers such feature packages by checking its vcpkg documentation or by using the vcpkg search command.

    Customizing the Portfile: If the default vcpkg behavior doesn't support the specific configuration you need, you might have to edit the portfile.cmake file for Assimp within the vcpkg repository. This file controls how the library is built and installed.

Here's how you can proceed:
1. Checking for Feature Packages

    List Available Features: Run the following command to see the available features for Assimp:

    bash

./vcpkg search assimp

This command will list Assimp and its features. Features are usually listed under the library name and start with a [ symbol.

Install with Specific Features: To install Assimp with only the features you want, use the following command format:

bash

    ./vcpkg install assimp[feature1,feature2,...]

    Replace feature1, feature2, etc., with the names of the features you want to include.

2. Customizing the Portfile

If the feature packages don't cover your needs, you can manually edit the portfile.cmake for Assimp:

    Locate the Portfile: Find the portfile.cmake for Assimp in your vcpkg directory. It's typically in a path like vcpkg/ports/assimp/portfile.cmake.

    Edit the Portfile: Open this file and look for the section where the build configuration is set up. You might need to modify the CMake arguments to include or exclude certain build options.

    Apply Customization: After editing, save the file and run the install command again:

    bash

    ./vcpkg install assimp

    This will rebuild Assimp with your customized settings.

Notes:

    Be Cautious: Editing the portfile.cmake can be tricky. Make sure to back up the original file before making changes.

    Updates and Maintenance: If you customize the portfile.cmake, note that updates to vcpkg could overwrite your changes. You might need to reapply them after updating vcpkg.

    Check for Updates: Sometimes, the vcpkg port for a library might be out of date. Check for any updates or patches that might already address your needs.

    Community and Documentation: Check the vcpkg and Assimp documentation and communities for any specific guidance or existing discussions about customizing Assimp builds.

By following these steps, you should be able to configure Assimp with only the features you need in your project using vcpkg.
User
assimp doesnt provide setting features like that

ChatGPT

If Assimp does not provide the option to set features directly through vcpkg, you would need to take a more manual approach to configure its build process. This typically involves modifying the build scripts or the CMake configuration for Assimp. Here's how you can approach it:
Using CMake Options Directly

    Download and Configure Manually: Instead of relying solely on vcpkg, you could download Assimp's source code and configure it manually using CMake. This way, you can specify the options you need.

    Set CMake Variables: When you run CMake to configure Assimp, you can pass the variables directly. For example:

    bash

    cmake -DASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_EXPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT=OFF -DASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_IMPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT=OFF -DASSIMP_BUILD_GLTF_IMPORTER=ON ..

    This command configures Assimp with only the GLTF importer enabled, as an example.

    Build and Install: After configuration, build and install Assimp as usual.

Integrating with vcpkg

If you need to integrate this custom build of Assimp back into your vcpkg workflow, it's a bit more complex:

    Custom Port File: You could create a custom port file in vcpkg for Assimp. This involves copying the existing Assimp port directory and modifying the portfile.cmake to include the CMake options you need.

    Referencing the Custom Port: After creating your custom port, you can tell vcpkg to use this port instead of the standard one. This might involve adjusting the vcpkg.json manifest file of your project or using command line arguments to point to your custom port.

Additional Considerations

    Maintenance Overhead: Customizing builds through vcpkg can lead to maintenance overhead, as you'll need to ensure your customizations stay up to date with any updates to Assimp.

    Compatibility: Ensure that your custom build of Assimp is compatible with the rest of your project's dependencies.

    Documentation and Community: It's always a good idea to check the Assimp and vcpkg documentation, as well as community forums or GitHub issues, for any advice or scripts that others might have shared for similar purposes.

This approach requires a good understanding of CMake and vcpkg's port system, but it provides a lot of flexibility in terms of how dependencies are built and integrated into your project.
User
when vcpkg installs assimp how can it know which flags to use to build it?
ChatGPT

When vcpkg installs a library like Assimp, it uses predefined build configurations specified in the port files of that library. These configurations are defined in the portfile.cmake and possibly other related scripts or files in the vcpkg ports directory. If you want vcpkg to use specific flags or options when building Assimp, you have a few options:
Editing the Portfile

    Locate the Portfile: The portfile.cmake for Assimp is located in the vcpkg directory under ports/assimp.

    Modify Build Options: Open portfile.cmake and look for the section where the build is configured, typically with vcpkg_configure_cmake or a similar command. Here you can modify or add CMake arguments to include the flags or options you want. For example, you might add lines like:

    cmake

-DASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_EXPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT=OFF
-DASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_IMPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT=OFF
-DASSIMP_BUILD_GLTF_IMPORTER=ON

Rebuild the Library: After modifying the portfile, rebuild Assimp using vcpkg:

bash

    ./vcpkg remove assimp --recurse
    ./vcpkg install assimp

Creating a Custom Port

If you don't want to modify the existing port directly:

    Copy the Existing Port: Copy the assimp directory from ports/assimp to a new directory, like ports/my-assimp.

    Modify and Use the Custom Port: Apply your modifications to the portfile.cmake in your custom port and then instruct vcpkg to use your custom port when installing Assimp.

Using Feature Flags

While Assimp might not support the feature flags you're interested in through vcpkg, you can still check if there are any other relevant features:

    Check Available Features: Run ./vcpkg search assimp to see if there are any predefined feature flags.

    Install with Features: If there are suitable features, install Assimp with ./vcpkg install assimp[feature1,feature2].

Notes

    Backup Original Files: Always backup the original portfile.cmake before making changes.

    Maintain Updates: Your changes might be overwritten when you update vcpkg. You’ll need to reapply them after an update.

    Test Your Changes: Ensure that your changes don't break the build and are compatible with your project requirements.

This approach requires a bit of familiarity with CMake and vcpkg's workings but allows for a great deal of customization in how libraries are built and used in your projects.

how can i tell vcpkg when installing assimp to use these cmake variables

SET(ASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_EXPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT OFF)
SET(ASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_IMPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT OFF)
set(ASSIMP_BUILD_GLTF_IMPORTER ON)
ChatGPT

To instruct vcpkg to use specific CMake variables when installing a library like Assimp, you generally need to modify the portfile.cmake file for that library in your vcpkg installation. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:
Step 1: Locate the Assimp Port File

    Navigate to the Ports Directory: In your vcpkg installation, go to the ports directory.
    Find Assimp Directory: Inside the ports directory, locate the assimp folder.

Step 2: Modify the Portfile

    Open portfile.cmake: In the assimp directory, you will find a file named portfile.cmake. Open this file in a text editor.

    Locate the CMake Configuration Section: Look for the section where CMake is invoked. This is typically done with a command like vcpkg_configure_cmake.

    Modify CMake Arguments: In this section, you can add or modify CMake arguments. You'll want to set the variables like this:

    cmake

    vcpkg_configure_cmake(
        SOURCE_PATH ${SOURCE_PATH}
        PREFER_NINJA
        OPTIONS
            -DASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_EXPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT=OFF
            -DASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_IMPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT=OFF
            -DASSIMP_BUILD_GLTF_IMPORTER=ON
        ...
    )

    Ensure these lines are correctly placed within the CMake configuration section and follow the syntax and structure used in the file.

Step 3: Install Assimp Using vcpkg

    Save Your Changes: After modifying and saving the portfile.cmake file, close the text editor.

    Run vcpkg to Install Assimp: Back in your command line, navigate to the root of your vcpkg installation and run:

    bash

    ./vcpkg install assimp

    This command will compile Assimp using the custom options you specified.

Additional Notes

    Backup Original Portfile: It's a good practice to back up the original portfile.cmake before making any changes.
    Compatibility and Testing: Ensure that the changes you make are compatible with your project and test the build thoroughly.
    Maintenance: Remember that if you update vcpkg, your changes might be overwritten. You'll need to reapply them after an update.

By following these steps, you can customize the build process of libraries managed by vcpkg, such as Assimp, to suit the specific needs of your project.

is tehre a way to alter portfile and reuse it in my project?
ChatGPT

Yes, you can alter a portfile.cmake for a library like Assimp in vcpkg and reuse it in your project. This is particularly useful if you want to maintain a consistent setup across different machines or team members. Here's how to do it:
1. Create a Custom Port

    Copy the Existing Port: Copy the entire directory of the library (e.g., ports/assimp) from the vcpkg repository to a directory in your project's source control. This could be a directory like my_vcpkg_ports/assimp.

    Modify the Portfile: Make your changes to the portfile.cmake in this new location, setting the CMake variables as required for your project.

2. Reference the Custom Port in Your Project

    Use the --overlay-ports Option: When you run vcpkg to install dependencies for your project, use the --overlay-ports option to specify the path to your custom ports directory. For example:

    bash

    ./vcpkg install assimp --overlay-ports=my_vcpkg_ports

    This tells vcpkg to use your custom port files instead of the ones in the main vcpkg repository.

    Include in Project Documentation: Make sure to document this step in your project's setup instructions so that everyone uses the correct portfile.

3. Commit to Source Control

    Add Custom Ports to Source Control: Add the my_vcpkg_ports directory to your source control. This ensures that everyone on your team uses the same configuration.

4. Integrate with Build Systems

    Automate in Build Scripts: If your project has build scripts or a continuous integration setup, modify them to use the --overlay-ports option as described above.

5. Handle Updates and Maintenance

    Monitor for Updates: Keep an eye on the official vcpkg repository for updates to the assimp port. You may need to merge these updates into your custom portfile.

    Reapply Changes if Necessary: After updating vcpkg or the assimp port, reapply any custom changes to the portfile.

Benefits and Considerations

    Consistency: This method ensures consistency across all setups for your project.
    Control: You have more control over the specific version and configuration of the dependencies.
    Maintenance: Requires ongoing maintenance to keep in sync with updates from the vcpkg repository.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage a custom build configuration for a vcpkg library and ensure that it is consistently used across your project.
User
i am using manifest mode vcpkg, how can I tell vcpkg when building assimp for my project what flags to use?
ChatGPT

When using vcpkg in manifest mode, you can customize the build process of a package like Assimp by specifying your desired CMake flags in the vcpkg.json manifest file of your project. This approach is convenient as it keeps your configuration centralized and version-controlled along with your project. Here's how to do it:
Step 1: Update Your vcpkg.json Manifest File

    Open vcpkg.json: This file should be in the root of your project directory.

    Add an overrides Section: You will need to add an overrides section if it doesn't already exist. This section allows you to specify custom build options.

    Specify the CMake Options: Within the overrides section, specify the CMake options for Assimp. Your vcpkg.json might look something like this:

    json

    {
        "name": "your-project-name",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "dependencies": [
            "assimp",
            // other dependencies
        ],
        "overrides": [
            {
                "name": "assimp",
                "port-version": 0,
                "builtin-baseline": "1234567", // This should be the commit hash of the version of assimp you want to use
                "extra-cmake-args": [
                    "-DASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_EXPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT=OFF",
                    "-DASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_IMPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT=OFF",
                    "-DASSIMP_BUILD_GLTF_IMPORTER=ON"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

    Replace "1234567" with the actual commit hash of the Assimp version you're using.

Step 2: Run vcpkg to Install Dependencies

    Use vcpkg to Install: Run vcpkg to install the dependencies as usual. The custom CMake arguments you specified in your vcpkg.json will be used to configure the Assimp build.

    bash

    ./vcpkg install

Additional Notes

    Version Control: Keep your vcpkg.json file under version control to maintain consistent dependency configurations across all environments.

    Compatibility: Ensure that the CMake options you specify are compatible with the version of Assimp you're using.

    Documentation: Include instructions in your project documentation about how dependencies are managed and built using vcpkg.

    Maintenance: You might need to update the overrides section if the Assimp library is updated or if you need to change the configuration.

By following these steps, you can have fine-grained control over how dependencies are built in your project using vcpkg in manifest mode, making it easier to maintain consistency and reproducibility across different development environments.
User
what about extending the port and just changing flags through

  "vcpkg-configuration": {
    "overlay-ports": [
      "./vcpkg/ports"
    ]
  },
ChatGPT

Using the overlay-ports feature in your vcpkg.json manifest file is an effective way to extend or override the default behavior of vcpkg ports, including changing the build flags for a package like Assimp. This method allows you to maintain a custom version of the port while still leveraging vcpkg's dependency management capabilities.

Here's how you can do this:
Step 1: Create a Custom Port

    Copy the Existing Port: Inside your project, create a directory that will hold your custom ports, for example, ./vcpkg/ports. Then, copy the entire assimp directory from your vcpkg installation's ports directory (usually found in vcpkg/ports/assimp) to ./vcpkg/ports/assimp.

    Modify the Portfile: Edit the portfile.cmake file in ./vcpkg/ports/assimp. Add or modify the CMake arguments to include the flags you want. For example:

    cmake

    vcpkg_configure_cmake(
        SOURCE_PATH ${SOURCE_PATH}
        PREFER_NINJA
        OPTIONS
            -DASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_EXPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT=OFF
            -DASSIMP_BUILD_ALL_IMPORTERS_BY_DEFAULT=OFF
            -DASSIMP_BUILD_GLTF_IMPORTER=ON
        ...
    )

Step 2: Update the vcpkg.json Manifest File

    Modify vcpkg.json: In your vcpkg.json manifest file, add the overlay-ports directive to point to your custom ports directory:

    json

    {
      "name": "your-project-name",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "dependencies": [
          "assimp",
          // other dependencies
      ],
      "vcpkg-configuration": {
          "overlay-ports": [
              "./vcpkg/ports"
          ]
      }
    }

    This tells vcpkg to use the ports in the specified directory as overlays, which will override the corresponding ports in the main vcpkg repository.

Step 3: Install Dependencies Using vcpkg

    Run vcpkg Install: When you run vcpkg to install dependencies, it will use the custom portfile for Assimp:

    bash

    ./vcpkg install

Additional Considerations

    Version Control: Include your custom ports directory (./vcpkg/ports) in your version control system to ensure consistency across different environments and team members.

    Maintenance: Keep an eye on updates to the Assimp port in the main vcpkg repository. You may need to merge changes from the main repository into your custom port from time to time.

    Documentation: Document this setup in your project's README or documentation to ensure that all contributors are aware of how dependencies are being managed.

By using overlay-ports in your vcpkg.json, you gain the flexibility to customize the build process of your dependencies while keeping the configuration alongside your project, making it easier to track and maintain.
User
yeah from these options it seems its much easier to use overrides and specify the versions and alter those than maintain the port by myself
ChatGPT

Yes, using the overrides feature in the vcpkg.json manifest file to specify custom build flags can indeed be a more straightforward and maintainable approach compared to maintaining a custom port. The overrides approach allows you to directly specify the versions and alter build configurations without the need to manually manage the complexities of the port's portfile.cmake.

Here's a brief overview of why the overrides method can be more convenient:
Simplicity

    Direct Configuration: You can directly specify the build flags in your project's vcpkg.json file, making it clear and concise.
    Less Maintenance: There's no need to copy and maintain the entire port folder, reducing the overhead of keeping track of upstream changes.

Version Control and Collaboration

    Easy to Share: The configuration is stored in a single file (vcpkg.json), which is easy to share and keep in version control, simplifying collaboration.
    Centralized Configuration: All changes are centralized, making it easier to review and understand modifications to dependency configurations.

Consistency

    Uniform Build Process: This approach ensures that everyone working on the project uses the same settings, reducing the chances of inconsistencies.
    Easier Updates: Updating dependencies and their configurations is more straightforward since it's all contained within the manifest file.

Reduced Complexity

    No Need to Edit Portfiles: Avoids the complexity of understanding and editing portfile.cmake, which can be quite detailed and requires a good understanding of CMake and vcpkg's internal workings.

Conclusion

Overall, using overrides in your vcpkg.json is an efficient way to customize dependency builds for your project. It keeps the process manageable, especially for larger teams or projects where consistency and ease of maintenance are crucial. Remember, though, to keep an eye on the compatibility of the flags with the specific versions of the libraries you are using, and update your configurations as necessary.
