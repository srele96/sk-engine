# How to upgrade

I don't know if correct, but... _For now..._

1. Go to: [glm releases](https://github.com/g-truc/glm/releases/tag/0.9.9.8)
2. Open the zip and copy only `glm` directory here _**(will replace the whole current directory)**_.
3. Copy the `copying.txt` here.
4. Copy this `README.md` so the instructions remain.
