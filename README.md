## Creation process

Babylon documentation - [First Scene and Model](https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/introductionToFeatures/chap1/first_scene)

Whether you are creating a whole world or just placing one model into a web page you need a scene to contain the world or model, a camera to view it, a light to illuminate it and, of course, at least one viewable object as a model. All models, whether just a box or a complex character, are made from a mesh of triangles or facets.
