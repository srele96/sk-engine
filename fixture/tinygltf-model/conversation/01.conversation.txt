tinygltf how do i use it through cmake with vcpkg
ChatGPT

Using tinygltf through CMake with vcpkg involves a few steps. Here's a general guideline to help you set it up:
1. Install Vcpkg

If you haven't already installed vcpkg, you can do so by cloning the repository from GitHub and running the bootstrap script. Here's how you do it on different platforms:
Windows

bash

git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat

Linux and macOS

bash

git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh

2. Install tinygltf with Vcpkg

Once vcpkg is installed, you can install tinygltf using the following command:

bash

./vcpkg install tinygltf

3. Integrate Vcpkg with Your Project

To use vcpkg with your CMake project, you need to set the CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE to the path of the vcpkg toolchain file. You can do this by passing it as a command-line argument to CMake:

bash

cmake -B [build directory] -S [source directory] -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[vcpkg root]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

Replace [build directory], [source directory], and [vcpkg root] with the appropriate paths.
4. Update CMakeLists.txt

In your CMakeLists.txt, you need to find the package and link it to your target:

cmake

# Minimum required version of CMake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)

# Your project name
project(YourProjectName)

# Find the tinygltf package
find_package(tinygltf CONFIG REQUIRED)

# Define your executable or library target
add_executable(YourTargetName main.cpp)

# Link tinygltf to your target
target_link_libraries(YourTargetName PRIVATE tinygltf::tinygltf)

Replace YourProjectName, YourTargetName, and main.cpp with your actual project name, target name, and source files respectively.
5. Build Your Project

Now, you can build your project using CMake:

bash

cmake --build [build directory]

Replace [build directory] with the path to your build directory.
Note:

    Ensure that the versions of CMake and vcpkg are compatible.
    The steps may vary slightly depending on your specific setup and requirements.

This should help you get started with using tinygltf in your CMake project with vcpkg.

cmake tinygltf
ChatGPT

To integrate tinygltf, a C++ header-only library for loading GLTF (GL Transmission Format) files, with a CMake project, you can follow these steps:

    Obtain tinygltf: First, you need to get the tinygltf library. You can clone it from its GitHub repository or add it as a submodule if you're using Git for your project.

    Include tinygltf in Your Project: There are several ways to include tinygltf in your project using CMake. One common method is to add it as a subdirectory if you have the whole tinygltf repository in your project structure.

    Modify CMakeLists.txt: In your CMakeLists.txt, you need to make the necessary modifications to include tinygltf. Here's a basic example of what your CMakeLists.txt might look like:

    cmake

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
    project(YourProjectName)

    # Add the tinygltf source directory
    add_subdirectory(path/to/tinygltf)

    # Define your executable or library
    add_executable(YourExecutable source1.cpp source2.cpp)

    # Link tinygltf to your target
    target_link_libraries(YourExecutable PRIVATE tinygltf)

    In this example, replace path/to/tinygltf with the actual path to the tinygltf directory in your project.

    Configure and Build: After setting up your CMakeLists.txt, you can configure and build your project as usual with CMake. This will include the tinygltf library in your build.

Remember that tinygltf is header-only, so you don't need to compile it separately. Including its directory in your project and linking it with your target should be enough for the compiler to find and use it.

Also, ensure that you meet any dependencies that tinygltf might have, such as a JSON parsing library, which is often required for loading GLTF files.

find package with tinygltf
ChatGPT

Using find_package in CMake for a header-only library like tinygltf is a bit different from using it with compiled libraries. tinygltf doesn't come with CMake support for find_package out of the box. However, you can manually integrate it into your CMake project. Here's how you can do it:

    Download tinygltf: First, you need to have tinygltf available in your project. You can clone it from its GitHub repository or download it manually.

    Create a Find Module: Since tinygltf does not natively support find_package, you will need to create a find module for it. This is a CMake script that tells CMake how to find and set up tinygltf.

    Create a file named Findtinygltf.cmake in your project's cmake directory (or in any directory that you will add to CMAKE_MODULE_PATH). Here's a basic template for such a file:

    cmake

# Findtinygltf.cmake

# Define a variable pointing to the tinygltf header location
find_path(TINYGLTF_INCLUDE_DIRS NAMES "tiny_gltf.h")

# Define the imported target
if(TINYGLTF_INCLUDE_DIRS)
    add_library(tinygltf INTERFACE)
    target_include_directories(tinygltf INTERFACE ${TINYGLTF_INCLUDE_DIRS})
endif()

# Handle the QUIETLY and REQUIRED arguments and set TINYGLTF_FOUND to TRUE if found.
include(FindPackageHandleStandardArgs)
find_package_handle_standard_args(tinygltf DEFAULT_MSG TINYGLTF_INCLUDE_DIRS)

This script tries to find the tiny_gltf.h file and sets up an interface library for it.

Include the Find Module in Your Project: In your project's CMakeLists.txt, add the directory where your Findtinygltf.cmake file is located to CMAKE_MODULE_PATH:

cmake

list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake")

Use find_package: Now, in your CMakeLists.txt, you can use find_package to find tinygltf:

cmake

find_package(tinygltf REQUIRED)

Link the Library: After finding tinygltf, link it to your target:

cmake

    target_link_libraries(YourTarget PRIVATE tinygltf)

    Replace YourTarget with the name of your executable or library target.

    Configure and Build Your Project: Run CMake to configure and build your project. CMake should now be able to find tinygltf and set it up correctly.

Remember, since tinygltf is a header-only library, there's no compiled component to it â€“ the find module essentially just helps CMake know where the header files are located.

since i download header for tinygltf using cmake, how can I use it in cmake?
ChatGPT

If you have downloaded the tinygltf headers using CMake, such as through CMake's FetchContent module, you can use it in your project with the following steps:

    Fetch tinygltf Using FetchContent: First, ensure that you are fetching tinygltf using FetchContent. This can be done by adding something similar to the following in your CMakeLists.txt:

    cmake

include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare(
  tinygltf
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/syoyo/tinygltf.git
  GIT_TAG        master # or specify a specific commit/tag
)

FetchContent_MakeAvailable(tinygltf)

This code will download tinygltf from its GitHub repository and make it available for use in your project.

Include tinygltf Directly: Since tinygltf is a header-only library, you don't need to link against it like you would with a compiled library. Instead, you just need to include the header directory in your target. If you've used FetchContent_MakeAvailable, CMake will handle this part for you.

Using tinygltf in Your Code: After setting up tinygltf in your CMake project, you can use it in your C++ code like any other header-only library. Just include the tiny_gltf.h header in your source files:

cpp

    #include "tiny_gltf.h"

    Configure and Build Your Project: Run CMake to configure your project, followed by your build system to compile it. The tinygltf headers should be automatically available to your compiler.

    Optional: Handling Dependencies: Depending on your use of tinygltf, you may also need to handle its dependencies. For example, tinygltf uses a JSON parser like nlohmann/json. You may need to add similar FetchContent declarations for these dependencies and link them to your target if necessary.

Here's a simple example of how your CMakeLists.txt might look:

cmake

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
project(YourProjectName)

include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare(
  tinygltf
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/syoyo/tinygltf.git
  GIT_TAG        master
)

FetchContent_MakeAvailable(tinygltf)

# Define your executable or library
add_executable(YourExecutable source1.cpp source2.cpp)

# Since tinygltf is header-only, no need to link it

In this setup, CMake takes care of downloading tinygltf and making its headers available for inclusion in your source files.
User
load model from the path using tinygltf
ChatGPT

To load a model from a path using tinygltf, you'll first need to include tinygltf in your project and then use its API to load the model. Here's a basic example of how you can do this in C++:

    Include tinygltf: Ensure that you have included the tinygltf header in your source file.

    cpp

#include "tiny_gltf.h"

Create a tinygltf Model and Loader: You need to create an instance of tinygltf::Model to store the loaded model data and tinygltf::TinyGLTF to handle the loading.

cpp

tinygltf::Model model;
tinygltf::TinyGLTF loader;

Load the Model: Use the LoadASCIIFromFile or LoadBinaryFromFile function of the loader object to load the model from a file. The function to use depends on whether your GLTF file is in ASCII (standard .gltf) or binary (.glb) format.

Here's an example of loading an ASCII GLTF file:

cpp

    std::string input_filename = "path/to/model.gltf"; // Replace with the actual model path
    std::string err;
    std::string warn;

    bool ret = loader.LoadASCIIFromFile(&model, &err, &warn, input_filename);

    // Check for warnings and errors
    if (!warn.empty()) {
        std::cout << "Warning: " << warn << std::endl;
    }

    if (!err.empty()) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << err << std::endl;
    }

    if (!ret) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to parse glTF" << std::endl;
    }

    Use the Model: If the model is loaded successfully, you can then use the model object to access the loaded data, such as meshes, materials, nodes, etc.

    Error Handling: Always check for errors and warnings after attempting to load the model, as shown in the example. This can help diagnose problems like file not found, parse errors, etc.

    Compile Your Code: Make sure to compile your code with a C++ compiler that supports the C++11 standard or later, as tinygltf requires it.

Here's a complete example snippet:

cpp

#include "tiny_gltf.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    tinygltf::Model model;
    tinygltf::TinyGLTF loader;
    std::string input_filename = "path/to/model.gltf"; // Replace with your model path
    std::string err;
    std::string warn;

    bool ret = loader.LoadASCIIFromFile(&model, &err, &warn, input_filename);

    if (!warn.empty()) {
        std::cout << "Warning: " << warn << std::endl;
    }
    if (!err.empty()) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << err << std::endl;
    }
    if (!ret) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to parse glTF" << std::endl;
        return -1;
    }

    // Model is now loaded and can be used
    // ...

    return 0;
}

Replace "path/to/model.gltf" with the actual file path to your GLTF model. Ensure that the file exists and the path is correct.
User
since tinygltf is header only i dont wanna copy it I wanna use the header downloaded by vcpkg what are my options
ChatGPT

If you have installed tinygltf using vcpkg and want to use it in your CMake project without copying the header files directly into your project, you can do so by leveraging CMake's find_package functionality and the integration that vcpkg provides. Here's how you can set it up:

    Integrate vcpkg with Your CMake Project: Ensure that your CMake project is set up to use packages from vcpkg. You typically do this by setting the CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE to the vcpkg toolchain file. This is usually done when you invoke CMake, like so:

    bash

cmake -B [build directory] -S [source directory] -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path to vcpkg]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

Replace [build directory], [source directory], and [path to vcpkg] with the appropriate paths.

Find tinygltf Package in CMakeLists.txt: In your CMakeLists.txt, use find_package to locate tinygltf. Since tinygltf is header-only, it might not come with CMake config files, so find_package might not work directly. If it doesn't, you'll need to manually specify the include directories. However, first, try using find_package:

cmake

    find_package(tinygltf CONFIG REQUIRED)

    Link tinygltf to Your Target: Because tinygltf is header-only, there is no library to link against. However, using target_include_directories ensures your project knows where to

User
yeah i only need include directories set
ChatGPT

If you've installed tinygltf via vcpkg and only need to set the include directories in your CMake project, you can do this easily. Here are the steps to configure your CMakeLists.txt:

    Ensure vcpkg Integration: Make sure that you have integrated vcpkg with your CMake project. This is usually done by passing the -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE parameter to CMake, pointing to the vcpkg toolchain file. It should look something like this:

    bash

cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

Replace /path/to/vcpkg with the actual path to your vcpkg installation.

Update CMakeLists.txt: In your CMakeLists.txt, you will set the include directories for your target. Since tinygltf is a header-only library, you don't need to link against a library, but you need to ensure that your project knows where to find the headers.

cmake

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
    project(YourProject)

    # Find the tinygltf package (if it's available as a CMake package in vcpkg)
    find_package(tinygltf CONFIG QUIET)

    if(tinygltf_FOUND)
        message(STATUS "tinygltf found")
        # If tinygltf provides a target, you can use it directly.
        # For example:
        # target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE tinygltf::tinygltf)
    else()
        # If tinygltf doesn't provide a CMake target, manually set the include directories
        # Assuming vcpkg installs tinygltf in a standard location
        include_directories(${_VCPKG_INSTALLED_DIR}/${VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET}/include)
    endif()

    # Define your executable
    add_executable(your_target source_file.cpp)

    Replace your_target and source_file.cpp with your actual target name and source file.

    Configure and Build: Run the CMake configuration and build steps as usual. This will set up your project with the include paths for tinygltf.

Note: The actual way tinygltf is integrated with vcpkg might vary. If tinygltf provides a CMake target when installed via vcpkg, it's more straightforward to use target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE tinygltf::tinygltf) after the find_package command. However, if it doesn't provide a target, you'll need to use include_directories to manually set the include path as shown above.
User
for some reason it expects tinygltf to be linked
ChatGPT

If CMake is expecting tinygltf to be linked, it suggests that the project or the way tinygltf is set up in vcpkg expects it to be used as a linked library, which is unusual for a header-only library. However, this can happen if the vcpkg port for tinygltf is configured to create an interface library for ease of use. Here's how you can handle it:

    Check for a Provided Target: If vcpkg provides a CMake target for tinygltf, you should use that target in your target_link_libraries call. This target would usually be named something like tinygltf::tinygltf. You can check if this target is available after your find_package call. If it's available, you should link against it:

    cmake

find_package(tinygltf CONFIG REQUIRED)

# Add your executable
add_executable(your_target source_file.cpp)

# Link against the tinygltf target
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE tinygltf::tinygltf)

Create an Interface Library If Necessary: If tinygltf doesn't provide a CMake target but CMake still expects it to be linked, you can create an interface library for it. This is a way to use header-only libraries in CMake that expect linking:

cmake

# Create an interface library for tinygltf
add_library(tinygltf_interface INTERFACE)
target_include_directories(tinygltf_interface INTERFACE ${TINYGLTF_INCLUDE_DIRS})

# Link this interface library with your target
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE tinygltf_interface)

Replace ${TINYGLTF_INCLUDE_DIRS} with the actual include directories path where tinygltf is located.

Fallback to Manual Include Directories: If none of the above methods work, and you're sure tinygltf is a header-only library, you can manually specify the include directories in your CMakeLists.txt:

cmake

    # Manually set the include directory for tinygltf
    include_directories(${_VCPKG_INSTALLED_DIR}/${VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET}/include)

    # Add your executable
    add_executable(your_target source_file.cpp)

In any case, make sure your CMakeLists.txt correctly reflects the way tinygltf is intended to be used as per its installation via vcpkg. If tinygltf is indeed header-only and there's a mismatch with how vcpkg is handling it, consider checking the vcpkg documentation or the tinygltf port in vcpkg for any notes or peculiarities.
User
so it has to be linked, why does it expect me to link the tinygltf?
ChatGPT

If your build system expects you to link tinygltf, despite it being a header-only library, there are a few potential reasons or scenarios that might be causing this:

    Interface Library: vcpkg or the tinygltf package might have set it up as an interface library. This is a common practice for header-only libraries to make them easier to use with CMake. An interface library in CMake doesn't compile into a binary but can carry usage requirements like include directories, compile options, or definitions. If tinygltf is set up this way, you'll find a CMake target provided for it (like tinygltf::tinygltf), and you'll need to link this target to your own targets.

    CMakeLists.txt Configuration: Your CMakeLists.txt might be set up in a way that assumes all libraries need to be linked, even if they are header-only. This could happen if the project was initially configured to work with compiled libraries and wasn't adjusted for header-only libraries.

    Misinterpretation of Error Messages: Sometimes, error messages can be misleading. An error that seems to suggest a linking issue might actually be about include paths or some other configuration issue.

    Vcpkg Integration: If vcpkg is involved, there might be special considerations or configurations that it applies to packages. It might create interface targets for ease of use, or there could be some peculiarity in how it handles tinygltf.

    Version or Compatibility Issues: There might be version or compatibility issues between the version of tinygltf you're using and your project or build system setup.

    Misconfigured Project or Build Scripts: If the project or its build scripts are misconfigured, it can lead to such issues. This can happen with complex projects or when transitioning between different ways of managing dependencies.

How to Handle It

    Use the Provided Target: If vcpkg provides a CMake target for tinygltf, use it. Add a target_link_libraries call to your CMakeLists.txt:

    cmake

    find_package(tinygltf CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE tinygltf::tinygltf)

    Check Your CMakeLists.txt: Review your CMakeLists.txt for any misconfigurations or assumptions about libraries needing to be linked.

    Consult Documentation: Check vcpkg and tinygltf documentation for any notes on usage with CMake and vcpkg.

    Interface Library: If no target is provided and you still face issues, consider creating an interface library as mentioned in previous messages.

Understanding the exact cause might require looking at the specific error messages you're getting and reviewing your project's CMake configuration in detail.

tinygltf says this

CMake options

You can add tinygltf using add_subdirectory feature. If you add tinygltf to your project using add_subdirectory, it would be better to set TINYGLTF_HEADER_ONLY on(just add an include path to tinygltf) and TINYGLTF_INSTALL off(Which does not install tinygltf files).

// Your project's CMakeLists.txt
...

set(TINYGLTF_HEADER_ONLY ON CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
set(TINYGLTF_INSTALL OFF CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
add_subdirectory(/path/to/tinygltf)
ChatGPT

Based on the information you provided, it looks like tinygltf can be included in your project using the add_subdirectory approach in CMake, with specific options to handle it as a header-only library. Here's how you can do this:

    Configure tinygltf Options: Before adding tinygltf as a subdirectory, set the necessary CMake options to indicate it's a header-only library and to prevent it from installing files globally. Add these lines to your CMakeLists.txt:

    cmake

# Set tinygltf as a header-only library
set(TINYGLTF_HEADER_ONLY ON CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
# Prevent installing tinygltf files
set(TINYGLTF_INSTALL OFF CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)

Add tinygltf as a Subdirectory: Use add_subdirectory to include tinygltf in your project. Ensure you provide the correct path to the tinygltf directory:

cmake

add_subdirectory(/path/to/tinygltf)

Replace /path/to/tinygltf with the actual path to tinygltf in your project or filesystem.

Link tinygltf to Your Target: After adding tinygltf, you can link it to your target. Even though it's header-only, setting it up this way might create an interface target that you can link against:

cmake

    # Add your executable or library
    add_executable(your_target source_file.cpp)

    # Link tinygltf to your target
    target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE tinygltf)

    Replace your_target and source_file.cpp with your actual target name and source file.

    Configure and Build Your Project: Run the CMake configuration and build steps as usual. This setup will include tinygltf in your project correctly as a header-only library.

This approach is useful because it allows you to manage tinygltf as part of your project, making it easier to control the version you're using and to integrate it with your build system. Remember to adjust the path to tinygltf as necessary based on where you've placed it relative to your project.
User
well if i were to use add subdirectory then I would need to add subdirectory to vcpkg include directory
ChatGPT

Using add_subdirectory to directly include a library from the vcpkg installed directory is not the standard or recommended approach. The add_subdirectory command in CMake is typically used for adding sub-projects or libraries that are part of your project's source tree. When using vcpkg, there are different, more suitable methods to include and use libraries in your project.

To use tinygltf installed via vcpkg in your CMake project, you should use the find_package mechanism provided by CMake, which is designed for this purpose. Here's how you can do it:

    Ensure vcpkg Integration with Your Project: Make sure your project is set up to use vcpkg's toolchain file. This is usually done by passing the -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE parameter to CMake:

    bash

cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

Replace /path/to/vcpkg with the path to your vcpkg installation.

Find and Use tinygltf in CMakeLists.txt: Use find_package to locate and set up tinygltf in your CMakeLists.txt. Assuming tinygltf provides a CMake configuration file (which is typically the case with vcpkg), it would look something like this:

cmake

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
    project(YourProject)

    find_package(tinygltf CONFIG REQUIRED)

    add_executable(your_target source_file.cpp)
    target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE tinygltf)

    Replace your_target and source_file.cpp with your actual target name and source file.

    Handling the Header-Only Nature: If tinygltf is truly header-only and find_package sets it up as such, the target_link_libraries command might actually just set up the include directories for you, not link against a binary library (since there isn't one).

    Configure and Build: Run CMake to configure your project and then build it as usual.

This approach is more aligned with how vcpkg and CMake are intended to be used together. It also simplifies dependency management and project configuration, especially when working with multiple dependencies or when sharing your project with others who might also use vcpkg.

User
can tinygltf work with vcpkg installing it then cmake bundling it
ChatGPT

Yes, tinygltf can indeed be installed using vcpkg and then bundled with a project using CMake. Here's a general overview of the steps you would follow:

    Install Vcpkg: If you haven't already, you'll need to install vcpkg on your system. This is a cross-platform C++ library manager that simplifies the installation and management of C++ libraries.

    Install tinygltf with Vcpkg: Once vcpkg is installed, you can install tinygltf using the following command:

    bash

./vcpkg install tinygltf

This command will download and install tinygltf along with its dependencies.

Integrate Vcpkg with Your CMake Project: You'll need to ensure that vcpkg is integrated with your CMake project. This typically involves setting the CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE variable to the path of the vcpkg toolchain file in your CMakeLists.txt or when invoking CMake. It would look something like this:

cmake

cmake -B [build directory] -S [source directory] -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[vcpkg root]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

Include tinygltf in Your Project: In your CMakeLists.txt, you can now find and link tinygltf to your target. Here is an example:

cmake

    find_package(tinygltf CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE tinygltf::tinygltf)

    Replace main with the name of your target.

    Build Your Project: Now you can build your project as usual with CMake. If everything is set up correctly, tinygltf will be included in your build.

    Handling Dependencies: Remember that tinygltf might have its own dependencies. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed and linked in your CMake project.

This is a basic outline, and your specific needs might require additional steps or modifications. Always refer to the documentation of vcpkg, tinygltf, and CMake for the most accurate and detailed information.
User
cmake requires tinygltf to be linked

how can I find out why
ChatGPT

If CMake requires tinygltf to be linked and you're encountering issues or errors, it's important to diagnose why this is happening. Here are several steps you can take to find out the reason:

    Check CMakeLists.txt: Ensure that tinygltf is correctly referenced in your CMakeLists.txt file. The find_package and target_link_libraries commands should be correctly configured.

    cmake

find_package(tinygltf CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE tinygltf::tinygltf)

Replace your_target with the actual target name in your project.

Review the Error Message: CMake usually provides detailed error messages. Check the error message to see if it's due to tinygltf not being found, a version mismatch, or other issues.

Verify tinygltf Installation: Ensure that tinygltf is properly installed via vcpkg. You can use vcpkg list to see if tinygltf and its dependencies are correctly installed.

Check Vcpkg and CMake Integration: Make sure the CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE is set to the vcpkg toolchain file. This is crucial for CMake to find packages installed via vcpkg.

cmake

    cmake -B [build directory] -S [source directory] -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[vcpkg root]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

    Examine the CMake Cache: Sometimes, the CMake cache can hold onto old values. Clearing the CMake cache (or deleting the CMake build directory) and reconfiguring might help.

    Check Environment Variables: Environment variables like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH can affect how CMake finds packages. Ensure these are correctly set if you're using them.

    Version Compatibility: Make sure that the version of tinygltf you're using is compatible with your project and the version of CMake you're using.

    CMake Version: Sometimes, issues can arise due to using an outdated version of CMake. Make sure you're using a recent version of CMake.

    Consult Documentation: Review the official documentation for tinygltf, vcpkg, and CMake. There might be specific instructions or notes relevant to your issue.

    Seek Community Help: If you're still stuck, consider seeking help from the community. Platforms like Stack Overflow, GitHub discussions for tinygltf or vcpkg, and CMake forums can be valuable resources.

    Verbose CMake Output: Running CMake with verbose output might provide additional clues. You can do this by adding --verbose or --debug-output to your CMake command.

By following these steps, you should be able to diagnose why tinygltf needs to be linked and resolve any issues you're encountering with CMake.

The situation you're describing is related to how tinygltf and certain header-only libraries are structured and used in C++ projects. Let's break down the reasons why it works without explicitly setting the include path and why the linker error was resolved by the defines:

    Header-Only Libraries: tinygltf is a header-only library. This means all the necessary code is in the header files themselves. There's no separate source file to compile into a library. This is why you don't necessarily need to link against a compiled library file (*.lib, *.a, etc.) as you would with other libraries.

    Automatic Include Directories: When you use vcpkg to install a library and integrate it with CMake, vcpkg handles a lot of the configuration automatically. This includes adding include directories to your project. That's why you didn't need to explicitly use find_path or target_include_directories for tinygltf. The header file tiny_gltf.h was already in the compiler's include path thanks to vcpkg.

    Defines for Implementation: Your last point is crucial. In header-only libraries like tinygltf, you often need to define certain macros before including the header file in one .cpp file to create the implementation. In the case of tinygltf, these macros are:
        TINYGLTF_IMPLEMENTATION
        STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
        STB_IMAGE_WRITE_IMPLEMENTATION

    These defines tell the preprocessor to include the implementation part of the code, which is typically guarded by #ifdef checks in the header file. If you omit these defines, the compiler only sees the declarations, not the implementations, leading to linker errors because the actual code is not compiled.

    Only Once in One Translation Unit: It's important to note that these defines should only be in one .cpp file in your project. If they're defined in multiple files, it will lead to multiple definition errors. This is a common pattern in header-only libraries.

In summary, tinygltf worked without explicit include directories because vcpkg and CMake handled the paths automatically. The linker errors were resolved by defining the macros necessary for the compiler to include the implementation parts of tinygltf and related libraries (stb_image, stb_image_write) in the build process. This is a typical usage pattern for many header-only libraries in C++.

does it even make sense to use these

set(TINYGLTF_HEADER_ONLY ON CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
set(TINYGLTF_INSTALL OFF CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
ChatGPT

In the context of using tinygltf, particularly when it's installed via vcpkg and integrated with a project using CMake, let's understand the purpose of these settings:

    TINYGLTF_HEADER_ONLY: This option is used to specify whether tinygltf should be used as a header-only library. Setting it to ON means you are explicitly instructing the build system to treat tinygltf as a header-only library. In the case of tinygltf, it is already a header-only library, so setting this option might be redundant if the library and your build system are already treating it as such.

    TINYGLTF_INSTALL: This option typically controls whether the library should be installed (e.g., copied to a system directory) as part of the build process. Setting it to OFF disables the installation step. When using vcpkg, this setting is generally managed by vcpkg itself. In most cases, when you're using a package manager like vcpkg, you don't need to manually set this option in your project, as the package manager handles installation and integration for you.

Considering these points:

    If you're using vcpkg to manage tinygltf, you generally don't need to manually set TINYGLTF_HEADER_ONLY to ON, as the library is already header-only and vcpkg knows how to handle it.

    Similarly, TINYGLTF_INSTALL being set to OFF is more relevant when you are manually building and installing tinygltf from source. With vcpkg, this step is unnecessary as vcpkg takes care of the installation.

In summary, when using vcpkg, these settings are typically not necessary to manually configure in your project's CMakeLists.txt, as vcpkg handles the appropriate configuration and installation of tinygltf. These settings are more relevant when you are manually building tinygltf from source and need to control its build and installation behavior.

using gltf, how would i

get 
  - vertices
  - indices
  - textures
  - textures maps
ChatGPT

To extract vertices, indices, textures, and texture maps from a GLTF file using tinygltf, you need to parse the GLTF file and then access the relevant data structures. Here's a high-level overview of how you can do this:
1. Parse the GLTF File

First, you need to load and parse the GLTF file. This is typically done using the tinygltf::Model class and the tinygltf::TinyGLTF loader.

cpp

#include <tiny_gltf.h>

tinygltf::Model model;
tinygltf::TinyGLTF loader;
std::string err;
std::string warn;

bool ret = loader.LoadASCIIFromFile(&model, &err, &warn, "path_to_gltf_file.gltf");

if (!warn.empty()) {
  // Handle warnings
}

if (!err.empty()) {
  // Handle errors
}

if (!ret) {
  // Failed to parse the GLTF file
}

2. Extract Vertices and Indices

Vertices and indices are stored in the mesh primitives of the model. Each mesh can have multiple primitives.

cpp

for (const tinygltf::Mesh &mesh : model.meshes) {
  for (const tinygltf::Primitive &primitive : mesh.primitives) {
    const tinygltf::Accessor &vertexAccessor = model.accessors[primitive.attributes.find("POSITION")->second];
    const tinygltf::BufferView &bufferView = model.bufferViews[vertexAccessor.bufferView];
    const tinygltf::Buffer &buffer = model.buffers[bufferView.buffer];

    // Access vertex data
    const float *vertices = reinterpret_cast<const float *>(&(buffer.data[bufferView.byteOffset + vertexAccessor.byteOffset]));

    // Similarly, access indices if they exist
    if (primitive.indices > -1) {
      const tinygltf::Accessor &indexAccessor = model.accessors[primitive.indices];
      const tinygltf::BufferView &indexBufferView = model.bufferViews[indexAccessor.bufferView];
      const tinygltf::Buffer &indexBuffer = model.buffers[indexBufferView.buffer];

      // Access index data
      const unsigned short *indices = reinterpret_cast<const unsigned short *>(&(indexBuffer.data[indexBufferView.byteOffset + indexAccessor.byteOffset]));
    }

    // Do something with vertices and indices...
  }
}

3. Extract Textures

Textures in GLTF are referenced by materials. You can access texture information through the material properties.

cpp

for (const tinygltf::Material &material : model.materials) {
  if (material.values.find("baseColorTexture") != material.values.end()) {
    int textureIndex = material.values.find("baseColorTexture")->second.TextureIndex();
    tinygltf::Texture &tex = model.textures[textureIndex];
    // Do something with the texture...
  }
}

4. Extract Texture Maps

Texture maps like normal maps, occlusion maps, etc., are also stored in the materials.

cpp

for (const tinygltf::Material &material : model.materials) {
  if (material.additionalValues.find("normalTexture") != material.additionalValues.end()) {
    int normalTextureIndex = material.additionalValues.find("normalTexture")->second.TextureIndex();
    tinygltf::Texture &normalTex = model.textures[normalTextureIndex];
    // Do something with the normal texture map...
  }
  // Similarly for other texture maps like occlusion, emissive, etc.
}

Considerations

    Data Formats: The vertex and index data can be in different formats (e.g., float, unsigned short, etc.). Ensure you handle these formats correctly based on the componentType in the accessor.
    Stride and Byte Offset: Pay attention to stride and byte offset in the buffer view for correct data access.
    Texture Loading: This code only provides the references to textures. You'll need additional code to actually load and use these textures in your rendering context.
    Error Handling: Add appropriate error handling and validation for real-world applications.

The above examples are simplified and intended to give you a general idea. In a practical application, you would need to handle more details and edge cases.

do i have to recursively iterate over each node in the gltf? how does gltf store stuff? does it contain scene?
ChatGPT

In a GLTF (GL Transmission Format) file, the data is stored in a structured, hierarchical manner that often includes a scene or multiple scenes. Each scene contains nodes, which can represent objects like meshes, cameras, lights, etc. Understanding this structure is crucial for correctly loading and displaying the content of a GLTF file. Here's a breakdown of the key components:
Scenes and Nodes

    Scenes: A GLTF file can contain one or more scenes. A scene is a collection of nodes.
    Nodes: Nodes are the elements of a scene. They can represent various things such as meshes, cameras, or other nodes (forming a parent-child hierarchy). Each node can have transformations applied to it (like translation, rotation, and scale) and can reference other resources like meshes or cameras.

Hierarchical Structure

    Parent-Child Relationships: Nodes can have children, forming a hierarchical structure. This hierarchy is crucial for representing complex models where parts are related or move relative to each other (like a rigged model).

Iterating Over Nodes

    To properly load a GLTF file, you often need to recursively iterate through each node in the scene(s). This is because the transformation of a node is relative to its parent, and you need to apply these transformations correctly to represent the model as intended.

Example of Iterating Over Nodes

Here's a basic example of how you might recursively iterate over the nodes in a GLTF scene:

cpp

void processNode(const tinygltf::Node &node, const tinygltf::Model &model) {
    // Process the node (e.g., read its mesh if it has one)
    if (node.mesh > -1) {
        // The node references a mesh, process it
        const tinygltf::Mesh &mesh = model.meshes[node.mesh];
        // Process the mesh (e.g., extract vertices, indices)
    }

    // Recursively process each child node
    for (int childIndex : node.children) {
        const tinygltf::Node &child = model.nodes[childIndex];
        processNode(child, model);
    }
}

// Start with the root nodes of a scene
for (const tinygltf::Scene &scene : model.scenes) {
    for (int rootNodeIndex : scene.nodes) {
        const tinygltf::Node &rootNode = model.nodes[rootNodeIndex];
        processNode(rootNode, model);
    }
}

What GLTF Contains

    Mesh Data: Vertices, normals, textures, indices, etc.
    Materials: Information about the appearance of surfaces.
    Textures: Image data used in materials.
    Animations: Keyframe data for animating nodes or meshes.
    Skins: Data for skeletal animations.
    Cameras: Perspective or orthographic camera definitions.
    Lights: Information about light sources (in extensions).

Conclusion

In summary, to fully utilize a GLTF file, you often need to iterate over its nodes, respecting their hierarchical relationships. This allows you to apply the correct transformations and render the scene as intended. The GLTF format is designed to be a complete representation of a 3D scene, including geometry, appearance, and often animation.
User
how many scenes can be within one model?
ChatGPT

A GLTF (GL Transmission Format) file can contain multiple scenes. The specification of GLTF does not impose a hard limit on the number of scenes within one model. Therefore, in theory, a GLTF file can contain as many scenes as needed, limited only by practical constraints like file size, memory usage, and performance considerations of the application processing the GLTF file.

Each scene in a GLTF file is a collection of nodes, which may include meshes, cameras, lights, and other elements. The flexibility to have multiple scenes allows for various use cases, such as:

    Different configurations or states of a model (e.g., different assembly stages of a product).
    Multiple variations of a scene within a single file (e.g., the same environment with different lighting conditions).

However, it's important to note that while the format allows multiple scenes, the typical use case often involves just one scene per GLTF file, especially in simpler or more common applications. When working with GLTF files containing multiple scenes, the application or engine processing the file needs to handle scene selection and rendering appropriately.

do i have to pass some flags to reader so it knows its embedded texture, triangulation, and inverting something?
ChatGPT

When using tinygltf to load GLTF files, there are certain flags and options that you might need to set to handle specific features like embedded textures, automatic triangulation of meshes, and inverting certain properties. These are usually determined by the specifics of your GLTF file and the requirements of your application.

Here are some common considerations:

    Embedded Textures: GLTF files can store textures in two ways: as external files or embedded within the GLTF file itself (using data URIs). tinygltf automatically handles embedded textures without needing special flags. It parses the data URIs and loads the embedded textures.

    Triangulation: GLTF models might contain meshes with polygons that are not triangles (e.g., quads). If your rendering pipeline only supports triangles, you'll need these to be triangulated. tinygltf does not automatically triangulate polygons into triangles. You might need to do this triangulation yourself after loading the model, or use a tool that can preprocess the GLTF file to convert all polygons to triangles.

    Inverting Properties: There are no generic flags in tinygltf for "inverting something". Inversion typically relates to specific properties like textures or coordinate systems. For example, the GLTF format uses a right-handed coordinate system, which might differ from the coordinate system of your rendering engine. Similarly, texture coordinates in GLTF are y-up, while some engines expect y-down coordinates. These kinds of inversions or conversions are not handled automatically by tinygltf and need to be implemented as part of your model loading or rendering logic.

    Additional Configuration: If you need to configure the loading process beyond the default behavior, you can modify the tinygltf::TinyGLTF loader's settings. For example, setting up custom file readers for external resources, handling specific extensions, or tweaking the parsing process.

    Default Behavior: For most standard use cases, tinygltf's default behavior should suffice. It handles the parsing of GLTF 2.0 files, including reading embedded textures and other basic elements without the need for additional flags.

In summary, while tinygltf handles many aspects of GLTF loading automatically, certain features like triangulation and specific coordinate system conversions are not automatically managed and may require additional handling in your code. Always check the specific needs of your application and the characteristics of the GLTF files you are working with.

this for example

aiProcess_FlipUVs
ChatGPT

The aiProcess_FlipUVs flag you're referring to is part of the Assimp library (Open Asset Import Library), not tinygltf. Assimp is a library used for importing various well-known 3D model formats, including GLTF, and it provides several post-processing flags to adjust the imported data. The aiProcess_FlipUVs is one of these flags and is used to flip the texture coordinates vertically.

In the context of GLTF and tinygltf:

    GLTF Texture Coordinates: GLTF uses a coordinate system where the origin (0,0) of texture coordinates is at the top left. This is in contrast to some graphics APIs like OpenGL, where the origin is at the bottom left, necessitating a vertical flip of the texture coordinates.

    Using tinygltf: tinygltf does not automatically flip texture coordinates because it aims to stay true to the GLTF specification. If you need to flip the UVs to accommodate your rendering pipeline (like OpenGL), you'll have to manually adjust the texture coordinates after loading the model.

    Manually Flipping UVs: If you need to flip the UVs vertically when using tinygltf, you can iterate through the texture coordinate data of the mesh and flip the y-coordinate. For example:

    cpp

    for (tinygltf::Mesh &mesh : model.meshes) {
        for (tinygltf::Primitive &primitive : mesh.primitives) {
            if (primitive.attributes.find("TEXCOORD_0") != primitive.attributes.end()) {
                const tinygltf::Accessor &accessor = model.accessors[primitive.attributes["TEXCOORD_0"]];
                const tinygltf::BufferView &bufferView = model.bufferViews[accessor.bufferView];
                const tinygltf::Buffer &buffer = model.buffers[bufferView.buffer];
                
                float *texCoords = reinterpret_cast<float *>(&(buffer.data[bufferView.byteOffset + accessor.byteOffset]));
                for (size_t i = 0; i < accessor.count; ++i) {
                    texCoords[i * 2 + 1] = 1.0f - texCoords[i * 2 + 1]; // Flip the Y coordinate
                }
            }
        }
    }

    No Direct Equivalent in tinygltf: There is no direct equivalent to aiProcess_FlipUVs in tinygltf. Any such transformations need to be manually coded.

    Why Libraries Don't Auto-Flip: Libraries like tinygltf and Assimp offer different philosophies. tinygltf adheres closely to the GLTF specification, while Assimp, being a more general importer, offers more flexibility in adapting the imported data to common graphics APIs.

In summary, if you are using tinygltf to load GLTF files and require UV coordinates to be flipped (for example, to match OpenGL's bottom-left texture origin), you'll need to implement this flipping manually after loading the model.
