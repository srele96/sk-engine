can i when using vulkan to render practice each vulkan API call to see what it does and figure out different ways to use it? for example, i feel like i have to setup the whole rendering thing before i can get anything on screen, and i limit myself "i must see a triangle, to know that it works, to experiment with API calls", however, is it possible for me to try out different settings and know whether they work or not? for example, trying out only this:

vkCreateInstance

or trying out this:

vkCreateDevice

etc... how would i know that device is ok? how would i know later that layout is created ok? how would i know that i created buffer properly? is there a way where i can in somewhat isolated way test a small set of API calls, like up to 5 or so, i don't want to have 1000 lines of code program before I'm able to test and mess around with details

Absolutely, breaking down the learning process into smaller, more manageable steps is a great approach. Here are some suggestions on how to experiment with Vulkan API calls in isolation or in small groups:

    Validation Layers:
        Enable Vulkan validation layers when creating the instance. They can provide valuable feedback about incorrect or invalid usage of the Vulkan API, which is invaluable when experimenting with different calls.
        For example, if you misuse vkCreateDevice, the validation layers will typically produce error messages explaining what you did wrong.

    Return Values:
        Check the return values of Vulkan functions. They will indicate whether the call succeeded or failed, and why.
        For instance, vkCreateInstance and vkCreateDevice return VK_SUCCESS on success, and other values (like VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY, VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED, etc.) on failure.

    Logging and Debugging:
        Add logging to your code to record the results of different Vulkan calls and the state of your program.
        Utilize debugging tools like RenderDoc to examine the state of your Vulkan objects.

    Small Test Programs:
        Create small test programs that focus on individual aspects of Vulkan, such as creating a Vulkan instance, device, swapchain, etc.
        This way, you can understand and experiment with each part of Vulkan without getting lost in a larger program.

    Read Vulkan Spec and Tutorials:
        For each Vulkan call, refer back to the Vulkan specification to understand what it does and what the parameters mean.
        Follow online tutorials to see how different Vulkan calls are used in context.

    Experimentation:
        Change parameters, call functions in a different order (while still adhering to Vulkan's ordering requirements), and see what happens.
        Try to create resources (like images, buffers, etc.) with different formats, usages, and flags to see how Vulkan reacts.

    Automated Testing:
        If you're comfortable, you might set up some automated testing to try out different configurations or scenarios. Automated testing frameworks can help you rapidly test different conditions and get immediate feedback.

    Read and Analyze Examples:
        Look at simple, well-commented examples online. Analyze the order of Vulkan calls, and how resources are set up and used.

    Interactive Debugging:
        If your development environment supports it, use interactive debugging to step through your code line by line, inspecting the state of your program and Vulkan objects as you go.

    Seek Community Help:
        If you run into problems or have questions, don't hesitate to seek help from the Vulkan community on forums, Reddit, or other platforms.

    Use Helper Libraries:
        Libraries like Vulkan-Hpp or vk-bootstrap can simplify some of the boilerplate setup, letting you focus on experimenting with different parts of Vulkan.

Remember, learning Vulkan is a marathon, not a sprint. Take your time to understand each part, and you'll build a strong foundation for tackling more complex rendering tasks in the future.

hmmm let's say that i would want to mess around with, let's say that i wanna create an instance, let's say there are no errors, how precise do i have to be when setting up each of these if i want to get anything on the screen? actually, can i just mess with those without actually rendering anything while being sure that i set it up  correctly?

---------------------------------------------------

Absolutely, you can certainly experiment with and verify many aspects of Vulkan setup without actually rendering anything to the screen. Many Vulkan functions return specific error codes when something goes wrong, which can provide immediate feedback about whether or not you've set things up correctly. Here's how you can go about it for some of the initial setup steps:

    Instance Creation:
        Use the vkCreateInstance function to create a Vulkan instance.
        Check the return value to see if the creation was successful (VK_SUCCESS), or if there was an error.
        You can also use Vulkan validation layers to provide extra debugging information. If validation layers are enabled, any issues with your instance creation should be flagged.

    Physical Device Selection:
        Once your instance is created, use vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices to get a list of physical devices.
        You can inspect the properties and features of these devices using vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties and vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures.

    Logical Device Creation:
        Use vkCreateDevice to create a logical device.
        Check the return value for success or failure.
        Again, validation layers can provide feedback if anything is set up incorrectly.

    Queue Family Selection:
        Use vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties to query the available queue families.
        Check to see if the queue families support the capabilities you need (e.g., graphics, compute, transfer operations).

    Swap Chain Creation:
        Use vkCreateSwapchainKHR to create a swap chain.
        Check the return value for success or failure.
        You can query the swap chain images with vkGetSwapchainImagesKHR.

    Querying and Inspecting Vulkan Objects:
        For many Vulkan objects, there are functions to query their state or properties, which can be useful for debugging and experimentation even before you start rendering anything.

    Testing Extensions and Layers:
        You can also experiment with enabling different extensions and layers to see how they affect your setup.

    Error Checking:
        It's crucial to check the return values of these functions for errors. If a function fails, it's a sign that something is wrong with your setup.

    Tools:
        Tools like Vulkan SDKâ€™s vulkaninfo command, or graphical tools like GPU-Z or RenderDoc can provide additional insights into the Vulkan setup even before rendering anything.

By meticulously checking return values, using validation layers, and using tools to inspect the state of your Vulkan setup, you can gain confidence that you've set things up correctly even before you start rendering to the screen. This way, you build up understanding step by step and ensure that each part of your setup is correct before moving on to the next part.

the great thing is that after these approximately 900 lines of code, i already have plenty of ideas of what i could try out and see how it interacts with other parts of the library, what i feel this gets me is

  - comfort
  - confidence when i see how each of these interact with others
  - looking for alternative ways to use them, call them, combine them
  - create mental images of how they work together allowing me to think of new ways to use them
  - and more...

and with those, i would be able to more confidently setup vulkan and get stuff to render on the screen, essentially through trial, error, and exploration of each of these, their interactions, etc... the same way i would practice mathematics, and other fields...
