Vulkan Instance Creation:

  Create a Vulkan instance, which is the connection between your application and the Vulkan library. Specify any desired instance-level extensions and validation layers.

Physical Device and Queue Family Selection:

  Enumerate and select a suitable physical device (GPU) from the available devices. Identify and select the necessary queue families (e.g., graphics, compute, transfer).

Logical Device and Queue Creation:

  Create a logical device, representing the chosen physical device and queue families. Retrieve handles to the queues from the logical device.

Window Surface Creation:

  Set up a window using a windowing system/library of your choice. Create a Vulkan surface for the window, to render the graphics onto.

Swapchain Creation:

  Create a swapchain, which handles the rendering output to the window surface.

Resource Creation:

  Load or create the necessary resources like textures, shaders, and buffers.

Pipeline Creation:

  Create the graphics and/or compute pipelines. Set up the pipeline states, including shader stages, vertex input, etc.

Rendering Loop:

  Implement the rendering loop, where you record command buffers and submit them to the GPU. Handle window resizing, input events, and other such runtime concerns.

Cleanup:

  Correctly release all Vulkan resources and cleanup before exiting the application.
