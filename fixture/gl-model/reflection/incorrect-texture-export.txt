reason materials or textures are not exported/embeded or whatever

https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/57531/fbx-export-why-there-are-no-materials-or-textures

missing path to the texture because it's not principled bsdf

ChatGPT:

Use glTF Viewer: There are online glTF viewers (like the Babylon.js Sandbox or
Don McCurdy's glTF Viewer) where you can drag and drop your exported file to see
if it appears correctly with the textures.

RIP, incorrect export, blank sides



first, it took me a while to come up with information that if texture's length
of 0 on a material means texture is not correctly imported

material contains colors and textures, nothing else, after i saw that information
from chatgpt i realized i might incorrectly export the model

i quickly asked gpt how can i verify if texture is there or not and it suggested
that i should check .gltf file which is textual representation of gltf format
and .glb is binary representation

i opened web browser with gltf viewer and realized that two sides of the cube
were blank which meant the texture was rendered incorrectly, or possibly
exported incorrectly...

i wonder how would i have been able to spot this information earlier, actually
i wonder when was this information relevant for me, because i was looking for
a way to see what model data do i have available when i import a model using
assimp

i feel like this data has been relevant for me for maybe, let me check, i think
i have it in the gpt chat...

it became relevant from the moment i asked where are images that i rendered
in the blender and why are all textures of length zero
and it became relevant only after i started to investigate those questions
i wonder if gpt gave me an answer and i was not able to understand it
if i was not able to understand it, then how could i have been able to
understand it
is there some sepcific training that i can do to avoid such situations?

the initial bias of thought and lack of clarity, i do not understand
a thing and initial thing i see in blender for example the way these
materials are grouped i thought i should see relevant information on imported
model but i did not and i was wondering why is it like that, i do not know
if i am able to comprehend all answers gpt gives me?

hmm i thought that a texture can somehow be a part of material, like stored on
material property because i stored it as such using blender and it took me
a while to understand that a texture should be correctly exported... i will
understand once i export the textures correctly, here are new conclusions

```
so if i get it right a texture is of a given type and i retrieve a path or
texture info if embedded from gltf model?
```

```
hm does it mean that i know only a texture info and a type of texture and
according to type i should implement a shader that correctly implements this
type such as shader for diffuse, specular, i do not get anything from the model
on how to handle diffuse or specular? because diffuse and specular are widely
known how they work?
```

both of these were correct understanding... it seems like that...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and then once i thought i understood the problem, i realized there was more
the blender doesn't export paths to textures, unless the texture is 
`principled bsdf` whatever that is, i should research

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

once i thought i understood the problem and what i need to do, i realized there
was more to understand, however i consistently pushed for more questions of how
to complete the task, rather than understanding the problem of why i can't
complete the task


RIP

```
ahhhhhh so gltf format EXPECTS the model to be optimized for PBR workflow,
physical based rendering, and therefore it was UNUSUAL and UNEXPECTED of me to
use diffuse bsdf while exporting to gltf, if I exported to other formats, then
these other formats are more optimized for some other stuff, so I was missing
information that each of these model formats are for different purposes and
solve different problem and for appropriate rendering stuff I should use
appropriate models, so in my situation, If i wanted diffuse texture, i should
have used principled bsdf and adjust it to contain a diffuse texture, did i get
that right?
```
